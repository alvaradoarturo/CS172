If you are able to do your job effectively without returning to campus, we urge you to talk with your supervisor about continuing to work remotely. As more people get vaccinated and the overall level of new COVID-19 cases declines across the country, we are easing out of the worst public health crisis in a generation. All returns to the workplace must be pre-approved. If you have any questions or concerns about this, please speak with your supervisor. The guidance below applies to all employees who perform duties on campus or UC leased or affiliated properties, unless the facility has expressly provided different instructions. Deans and unit heads will determine which groups are needed to work in person. For those who are approved to return, we are instituting new protocols designed to protect yourself and others. We expect all on-campus workers to abide by the guidelines and directives described below.SupervisorsAuthorization.\u00a0Provide authorization for each employee to report onsite.\u00a0Worksite specific plan.

Some of our buildings are much older and have some limitations. Our buildings are designed to provide sufficientair changes based on building activities. We are making a special effort to ensure that all buildings have current filter changes. The information below is how HVAC systems are maintained.Expanded Timeframe: To help with airflow, Facilities Services is expanding the length of time outside airflow will circulate throughout each building.Filtration Maintenance: Building filtration systems are well maintained and have the appropriate level of filters for each building.Air Flow: To accommodate efficient airflow in each building, the most advanced level of filtersare being used based on the building\u2019s air filtration system capabilities.Building VentilationStrict adherence to the public health posters and other visual cues throughout campus and in buildings will reduce transmission risks. Ventilation systems will continue to operate as designed even thoughbuilding occupancy will be reduced. This will further reduce the risk of potential airborne transmission.\u00a0 While each individual occupant of a campus building will want to make sure these guidelines arefollowed, including limited occupancy, it will be very important to ensure that all the other occupants in that building, at least on that same floor, coordinate to ensure the overall density and guidelines arebeing followed on a collective basis.Transmission Reduction EffortsAccording to the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), the COVID-19 virus appears to spread human-to-human through respiratory droplets coming from an infected person. Based on public health guidance, the key transmission reduction factors include:social distancing,limiting occupancy,practicing good personal hygiene, andutilizing face coveringsAs part of the public health guidance, Facilities Services will disinfect high-touch areas including elevators, door handles, common areas and restrooms. We have made disinfecting kits available to departments and hand sanitizing stations are located at the entrance of each building. A map locating sanitizing stations can be viewed by clicking here.\u00a0HVAC ventilation FAQ'sResources and SOPsSignageThe campus has developed standard signage and postings for building entrances, exits, stairs, elevators and more.
