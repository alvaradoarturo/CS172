Last year was a consequential one, necessitating adaptation and growth in every aspect of society, including in the CEE department. Through it all, our students, faculty, staff and alumni have demonstrated their leadership, resilience and deep commitment to supporting the innovative education and cutting-edge research that are the hallmarks of our department.\u00a0Making the health and safety of our entire community our highest priority, our dedicated faculty worked hard to completely transform our curriculum for online instruction. Students have responded with continued productivity, a testament to the rigors of a UC education. Last summer, as our nation turned its attention to the critical need to address racial injustice, CEE leadership, faculty, staff and students took a strong stand in supporting the Black Lives Matter movement. We work hard to ensure that our education and our research contribute to building a just and equitable society.Read more >>\u00a0Research Focus Areas   Environment & Energy Structures Transportation Water Department News                      May 27, 2021        Two Henry Samueli School of Engineering Scientists Win DOE Early Career Awards                    May 17, 2021        Greenhouse Gas and Aerosol Emissions are Lengthening and Intensifying Droughts                    May 10, 2021        Dean\u2019s Distinguished Lecture Series Welcomes Stephen Pacala                    April 30, 2021        Foufoula-Georgiou Contributes to U.S. Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board Report, Issued Today    View more News  Contact UsSamueli School of Engineering5200 Engineering HallIrvine, CA 92697-2700+1-949-824-4333\u00a0Undergraduate Student Affairs+1-949-824-4334ugengr@uci.edu\u00a0Graduate and Professional Studies+1-949-824-8090gradengr@uci.eduDiscover SamueliAccessibilitySafety ProceduresEmploymentProspective StudentsUndergraduateGraduateCurrent StudentsUndergraduateGraduateGive to Samueli SchoolVisit the School2020 Dean\u2019s ReportStyle GuideAnt-eaterTwitterFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInMail\u00a92021 Samueli School of EngineeringUniversity of California, IrvineAboutInterim Deans MessageStrategic PlanFacts and FiguresHenry SamueliSchool LeadershipEngineering Leadership CouncilAccreditationOrange CountyEmploymentFaculty PositionsView All Open PositionsApplication HelpLecturer PositionsPostdoctoral Scholar PositionsResearch PositionsOpen Samueli School of Engineering Staff PositionsVisit UsDriving DirectionsParking and MapsWalking MapUCI Campus MapsGot Questions?AdmissionsUndergraduateEnrollment and Degrees AwardedWhy UCI?Study AbroadSouthern California LocationExperiential LearningResearch OpportunitiesCampus LivingChemistry for EngineeringProgram in International Engineering PIEEntrepreneurial OpportunitiesStudent GroupsHow to ApplyDeadlinesFinancial AidAdmissions OfficeProspective StudentsUCI-IVC Engineering AcademyEngineering AmbassadorsNewly AdmittedFreshmenTransfersMajors and Minors OfferedFrequently Asked QuestionsContact UsGraduatePrograms and ConcentrationsHow to ApplyAccelerated Status ProgramInternational FellowshipsMeet Us on the RoadFrequently Asked QuestionsPhD and Masters Inquiry FormContact UsResearchEngineering Phase 3 Research RestartResearch Support / ERMEngineering Coronavirus SolutionsMessage from the Associate DeanResearch ThrustsAdvanced Manufacturing and MaterialsCommunications and Information TechnologyEnergy and SustainabilityHuman HealthResearch by DepartmentResearch Centers, Institutes and FacilitiesCommercializationUndergraduate ResearchInternational CollaborationsInterdisciplinary Science and Engineering Building ISEBIndustryCorporate Partners ProgramAnnual Membership LevelsConnect with StudentsJobs/InternshipsEngiTECHPrototyping ServicesSponsored ResearchEngineering Leadership CouncilExternal Relations OfficeOutreachK-12APPcampASPIREAthena OlympiadCardioStartFABcampLab to Lesson PlanMESASt. Margaret\u2019s ProgramCommunity CollegeInternationalInternational OpportunitiesInclusionIDEA - Inclusion, Diversity, Equity, AccessOffice of Access and InclusionNews & EventsNewsroomArchivesSamueli ShoutoutsArchivesMedia WatchArchivesVideo ArchiveDeans ReportFacts & FiguresEventsArchivesE-Newsletter202120202019201820172016Social MediaContact UsStyle GuideColor PaletteWordmarksFor PrintFor Web/DigitalDept WordmarksFor PrintFor Web/DigitalPowerPoint Current StudentsUndergraduateAcademic Advising & SupportAcademic CounselingFaculty AdvisementEngineering MentorsComputing SupportAcademic Planning & ResourcesAcademic Opportunities & ResearchProgram in International Engineering PIEFinancial SupportMerit Based ScholarshipsOnline Forms & ResourcesCalendar & DeadlinesCareer ResourcesClubs and OrganizationsE-Week 2021Frequently Asked QuestionsContact UsGraduateAdvisors & CoordinatorsGraduate Studies CommitteeCurricular Practical TrainingDeadlinesSummer 2021Fall 2020Winter 2021Spring 2021New Graduate StudentsPh.D. MilestonesPolicies & ProceduresResourcesFinancial SupportCurrent FellowshipsInternal FellowshipsExternal FellowshipsNamed FellowshipsHenry Samueli Endowed FellowshipHolmes Endowed FellowshipStudent EmploymentTeaching Assistant FAQsZotChatContact UsAdditional ResourcesEngineering Student Study/Meeting SpaceFree SoftwareDepartmentsBiomedical EngineeringMessage From ChairAboutFacts & FiguresUndergraduateEducational MissionsBiomedical Engineering ProgramBiomedical Engineering: PremedicalBiomedical EngineeringBiomedical Engineering: PremedicalBiomedical Engineering MinorGraduateWhy Apply?

If you are able to do your job effectively without returning to campus, we urge you to talk with your supervisor about continuing to work remotely. As more people get vaccinated and the overall level of new COVID-19 cases declines across the country, we are easing out of the worst public health crisis in a generation. All returns to the workplace must be pre-approved. If you have any questions or concerns about this, please speak with your supervisor. The guidance below applies to all employees who perform duties on campus or UC leased or affiliated properties, unless the facility has expressly provided different instructions. Deans and unit heads will determine which groups are needed to work in person. For those who are approved to return, we are instituting new protocols designed to protect yourself and others. We expect all on-campus workers to abide by the guidelines and directives described below.SupervisorsAuthorization.\u00a0Provide authorization for each employee to report onsite.\u00a0Worksite specific plan.

Some of our buildings are much older and have some limitations. Our buildings are designed to provide sufficientair changes based on building activities. We are making a special effort to ensure that all buildings have current filter changes. The information below is how HVAC systems are maintained.Expanded Timeframe: To help with airflow, Facilities Services is expanding the length of time outside airflow will circulate throughout each building.Filtration Maintenance: Building filtration systems are well maintained and have the appropriate level of filters for each building.Air Flow: To accommodate efficient airflow in each building, the most advanced level of filtersare being used based on the building\u2019s air filtration system capabilities.Building VentilationStrict adherence to the public health posters and other visual cues throughout campus and in buildings will reduce transmission risks. Ventilation systems will continue to operate as designed even thoughbuilding occupancy will be reduced. This will further reduce the risk of potential airborne transmission.\u00a0 While each individual occupant of a campus building will want to make sure these guidelines arefollowed, including limited occupancy, it will be very important to ensure that all the other occupants in that building, at least on that same floor, coordinate to ensure the overall density and guidelines arebeing followed on a collective basis.Transmission Reduction EffortsAccording to the World Health Organization WHO and the Centers for Disease Control CDC, the COVID-19 virus appears to spread human-to-human through respiratory droplets coming from an infected person. Based on public health guidance, the key transmission reduction factors include:social distancing,limiting occupancy,practicing good personal hygiene, andutilizing face coveringsAs part of the public health guidance, Facilities Services will disinfect high-touch areas including elevators, door handles, common areas and restrooms. We have made disinfecting kits available to departments and hand sanitizing stations are located at the entrance of each building. A map locating sanitizing stations can be viewed by clicking here.\u00a0HVAC ventilation FAQsResources and SOPsSignageThe campus has developed standard signage and postings for building entrances, exits, stairs, elevators and more.
