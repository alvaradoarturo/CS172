Last year was a consequential one, necessitating adaptation and growth in every aspect of society, including in the CEE department. Through it all, our students, faculty, staff and alumni have demonstrated their leadership, resilience and deep commitment to supporting the innovative education and cutting-edge research that are the hallmarks of our department.\u00a0Making the health and safety of our entire community our highest priority, our dedicated faculty worked hard to completely transform our curriculum for online instruction. Students have responded with continued productivity, a testament to the rigors of a UC education. Last summer, as our nation turned its attention to the critical need to address racial injustice, CEE leadership, faculty, staff and students took a strong stand in supporting the Black Lives Matter movement. We work hard to ensure that our education and our research contribute to building a just and equitable society.Read more >>\u00a0Research Focus Areas   Environment & Energy Structures Transportation Water Department News                      June 8, 2021        Alumna Elizabeth Gayle Reflects on Returning Home to Guam, Breaking Barriers and Anteater Life                    May 27, 2021        Two Henry Samueli School of Engineering Scientists Win DOE Early Career Awards                    May 17, 2021        Greenhouse Gas and Aerosol Emissions are Lengthening and Intensifying Droughts                    May 10, 2021        Dean\u2019s Distinguished Lecture Series Welcomes Stephen Pacala    View more News  Contact UsSamueli School of Engineering5200 Engineering HallIrvine, CA 92697-2700+1-949-824-4333\u00a0Undergraduate Student Affairs+1-949-824-4334ugengr@uci.edu\u00a0Graduate and Professional Studies+1-949-824-8090gradengr@uci.eduDiscover SamueliAccessibilitySafety ProceduresEmploymentProspective StudentsUndergraduateGraduateCurrent StudentsUndergraduateGraduateGive to Samueli SchoolVisit the School2020 Dean\u2019s ReportStyle GuideAnt-eaterTwitterFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInMail\u00a92021 Samueli School of EngineeringUniversity of California, IrvineAboutInterim Deans MessageStrategic PlanFacts and FiguresHenry SamueliSchool LeadershipEngineering Leadership CouncilAccreditationOrange CountyEmploymentFaculty PositionsView All Open PositionsApplication HelpLecturer PositionsPostdoctoral Scholar PositionsResearch PositionsOpen Samueli School of Engineering Staff PositionsVisit UsDriving DirectionsParking and MapsWalking MapUCI Campus MapsGot Questions?AdmissionsUndergraduateEnrollment and Degrees AwardedWhy UCI?Study AbroadSouthern California LocationExperiential LearningResearch OpportunitiesCampus LivingChemistry for EngineeringProgram in International Engineering PIEEntrepreneurial OpportunitiesStudent GroupsHow to ApplyDeadlinesFinancial AidAdmissions OfficeProspective StudentsUCI-IVC Engineering AcademyEngineering AmbassadorsNewly AdmittedFreshmenTransfersMajors and Minors OfferedFrequently Asked QuestionsContact UsGraduatePrograms and ConcentrationsHow to ApplyAccelerated Status ProgramInternational FellowshipsMeet Us on the RoadFrequently Asked QuestionsPhD and Masters Inquiry FormContact UsResearchEngineering Phase 3 Research RestartResearch Support / ERMEngineering Coronavirus SolutionsMessage from the Associate DeanResearch ThrustsAdvanced Manufacturing and MaterialsCommunications and Information TechnologyEnergy and SustainabilityHuman HealthResearch by DepartmentResearch Centers, Institutes and FacilitiesCommercializationUndergraduate ResearchInternational CollaborationsInterdisciplinary Science and Engineering Building ISEBIndustryCorporate Partners ProgramAnnual Membership LevelsConnect with StudentsJobs/InternshipsEngiTECHPrototyping ServicesSponsored ResearchEngineering Leadership CouncilExternal Relations OfficeOutreachK-12APPcampASPIREAthena OlympiadCardioStartFABcampLab to Lesson PlanMESASt. Margaret\u2019s ProgramCommunity CollegeInternationalInternational OpportunitiesInclusionIDEA - Inclusion, Diversity, Equity, AccessOffice of Access and InclusionNews & EventsNewsroomArchivesSamueli ShoutoutsArchivesMedia WatchArchivesVideo ArchiveDeans ReportFacts & FiguresEventsArchivesE-Newsletter202120202019201820172016Social MediaContact UsStyle GuideColor PaletteWordmarksFor PrintFor Web/DigitalDept WordmarksFor PrintFor Web/DigitalPowerPoint Current StudentsUndergraduateAcademic Advising & SupportAcademic CounselingFaculty AdvisementEngineering MentorsComputing SupportAcademic Planning & ResourcesAcademic Opportunities & ResearchProgram in International Engineering PIEFinancial SupportMerit Based ScholarshipsOnline Forms & ResourcesCalendar & DeadlinesCareer ResourcesClubs and OrganizationsE-Week 2021Frequently Asked QuestionsContact UsGraduateAdvisors & CoordinatorsGraduate Studies CommitteeCurricular Practical TrainingDeadlinesSummer 2021Fall 2020Winter 2021Spring 2021New Graduate StudentsPh.D. MilestonesPolicies & ProceduresResourcesFinancial SupportCurrent FellowshipsInternal FellowshipsExternal FellowshipsNamed FellowshipsHenry Samueli Endowed FellowshipHolmes Endowed FellowshipStudent EmploymentTeaching Assistant FAQsZotChatContact UsAdditional ResourcesEngineering Student Study/Meeting SpaceFree SoftwareDepartmentsBiomedical EngineeringMessage From ChairAboutFacts & FiguresUndergraduateEducational MissionsBiomedical Engineering ProgramBiomedical Engineering: PremedicalBiomedical EngineeringBiomedical Engineering: PremedicalBiomedical Engineering MinorGraduateWhy Apply?

If you are able to do your job effectively without returning to campus, we urge you to talk with your supervisor about continuing to work remotely. As more people get vaccinated and the overall level of new COVID-19 cases declines across the country, we are easing out of the worst public health crisis in a generation. All returns to the workplace must be pre-approved. If you have any questions or concerns about this, please speak with your supervisor. The guidance below applies to all employees who perform duties on campus or UC leased or affiliated properties, unless the facility has expressly provided different instructions. Deans and unit heads will determine which groups are needed to work in person. For those who are approved to return, we are instituting new protocols designed to protect yourself and others. We expect all on-campus workers to abide by the guidelines and directives described below.SupervisorsAuthorization.\u00a0Provide authorization for each employee to report onsite.\u00a0Worksite specific plan.

Some of our buildings are much older and have some limitations. Our buildings are designed to provide sufficientair changes based on building activities. We are making a special effort to ensure that all buildings have current filter changes. The information below is how HVAC systems are maintained.Expanded Timeframe: To help with airflow, Facilities Services is expanding the length of time outside airflow will circulate throughout each building.Filtration Maintenance: Building filtration systems are well maintained and have the appropriate level of filters for each building.Air Flow: To accommodate efficient airflow in each building, the most advanced level of filtersare being used based on the building\u2019s air filtration system capabilities.Building VentilationStrict adherence to the public health posters and other visual cues throughout campus and in buildings will reduce transmission risks. Ventilation systems will continue to operate as designed even thoughbuilding occupancy will be reduced. This will further reduce the risk of potential airborne transmission.\u00a0 While each individual occupant of a campus building will want to make sure these guidelines arefollowed, including limited occupancy, it will be very important to ensure that all the other occupants in that building, at least on that same floor, coordinate to ensure the overall density and guidelines arebeing followed on a collective basis.Transmission Reduction EffortsAccording to the World Health Organization WHO and the Centers for Disease Control CDC, the COVID-19 virus appears to spread human-to-human through respiratory droplets coming from an infected person. Based on public health guidance, the key transmission reduction factors include:social distancing,limiting occupancy,practicing good personal hygiene, andutilizing face coveringsAs part of the public health guidance, Facilities Services will disinfect high-touch areas including elevators, door handles, common areas and restrooms. We have made disinfecting kits available to departments and hand sanitizing stations are located at the entrance of each building. A map locating sanitizing stations can be viewed by clicking here.\u00a0HVAC ventilation FAQsResources and SOPsSignageThe campus has developed standard signage and postings for building entrances, exits, stairs, elevators and more.

The project will be led by bioengineering professor Xiaoping Hu and psychology professor Aaron Seitz. The location of the locus coeruleus in the brain. Wikimedia CommonsThe locus coeruleus is a region of the brain involved with physiological responses to stress and fear. It is the primary producer in the brain of norepinephrine, a hormone that activates the body\u2019s \u201cfight or flight\u201d response to frightening or stressful situations by increasing heart rate, releasing glucose into the bloodstream, and increasing blood flow to the muscles. \u00a0In the brain, norepinephrine acts as a neurotransmitter, passing messages between neurons to increase alertness and reaction time, and affect mood and ability to concentrate. There is substantial evidence that the locus coeruleus circuit plays a central role in cognitive processes. Neuronal loss in the locus coeruleus is known to occur in neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer\u2019s disease and related dementias and Parkinson\u2019s disease dementia.\u00a0Scientists think healthy locus coeruleus neurons preserve cognitive abilities during normal aging, but few studies have examined differences between individuals to establish a baseline. The locus coeruleus is small and difficult to image, so most research to date has used pupil dilation as a surrogate measure of locus coeruleus activity.Hu and Seitz, along with UC Riverside psychology colleagues Illana Bennett and Weiwei Zhang, and Megan Peters at UC Irvine, have pioneered advanced neuroimaging methods to image the locus coeruleus.\u00a0They will conduct detailed psychophysical and magnetic resonance imaging studies of older adults to understand how locus coeruleus structure and function regulates behavior and how this, in turn, is mediated by activity in other brain regions known to be involved in perception and memory. Their efforts will allow them to use computational approaches to define individual differences in the way locus coeruleus circuit integrity relates to different patterns of cognitive performance across tasks.The team hopes their work can help explain how dysfunctional modulatory circuits may generate cognitive declines or be implicated in normal aging and age-related disorders such as Alzheimer\u2019s and related disorders. The results have the potential to support noninvasive methods for diagnosing pathologies associated with locus coeruleus decline and developing new treatments.Header photo:\u00a0Artyom Kabajev\u00a0on\u00a0\u00a0UnsplashShare this ArticleMedia ContactsTagsBourns College Of EngineeringCollege Of Natural And Agricultural SciencesDepartment Of BioengineeringDepartment of PsychologyNeuroscienceAlzheimersXiaoping HuAaron SeitzScience / TechnologyRelated ArticlesScience / TechnologyUCR joins forces with NASA on missions to VenusScience / TechnologyA new water treatment technology could also help Mars explorersScience / TechnologyA new dimension in the quest to understand dark matter Science / Technology$3 million grant aims to prolong life for dialysis patientsSearchUniversity of California, Riverside900 University Ave.            Riverside, CA 92521Tel: 951 827-1012UCR LibraryCampus StatusCampus StoreCareer OpportunitiesDiversityMaps and DirectionsVisit UCRUniversity of California, Riverside             900 University Ave.            Riverside, CA 92521                          tel: 951 827-0000                        email: webmaster@ucr.edu  Find UsFollow US:Related LinksUCR News ArchiveScience TodayServicio de Informaci\u00f3n en Espa\u00f1olUC Agricultural and Natural Resources newsUC NewsroomAvailable FeedsCreator State PodcastPrivacy PolicyTerms and Conditions\u00a9 2021 Regents of the University of CaliforniaSearch\u00d7Let us help you with your searchEnter your Search Criteria.Search All UCRSearch This SiteCancel"}, {"id": 44, "url": "https://news.ucr.edu/articles/2021/06/03/new-water-treatment-technology-could-also-help-mars-explorers/", "html": "COVID-19\u00a0information, guidance, and resources.

As a powerful oxidizer, perchlorate is also manufactured and used in solid rocket fuel, fireworks, munitions, airbag initiators for vehicles, matches and signal flares. It is\u00a0a byproduct in some disinfectants and herbicides.\u00a0 Jinyong LiuBecause of its ubiquity in both soil and industrial goods, perchlorate is a common water contaminant that causes certain thyroid disorders. Perchlorate\u00a0bioaccumulates in plant tissues and a large amount of perchlorate found in Martian soil could make food grown there unsafe to eat, limiting the potential for human settlements on Mars. Perchlorate in Martian dust could also be hazardous to explorers. Current methods of removing perchlorate from water require either harsh conditions or a multistep enzymatic process to lower the oxidation state of the chlorine element into the harmless chloride ion.Doctoral student Changxu Ren and Jinyong Liu, an assistant professor of chemical and environmental engineering at UC Riverside\u2019s Marlan and Rosemary Bourns College of Engineering, took inspiration from nature to reduce perchlorate in water at ambient pressure and temperature in one simple step.Ren and Liu noted anaerobic microbes use molybdenum in their enzymes to reduce perchlorate and harvest energy in oxygen-starved environments.\u201cPrevious efforts in constructing a chemical molybdenum catalyst for perchlorate reduction have not been successful,\u201d Liu said. \u201cMany other metal catalysts either require harsh conditions or are not compatible with water.\u201d Changxu RenThe researchers tried to emulate the complicated microbial perchlorate reduction process with a simplified approach. They found by simply mixing a common fertilizer called sodium molybdate, a common organic ligand called bipyridine to bind the molybdenum, and a common hydrogen-activating catalyst called palladium on carbon, they produced a powerful catalyst that quickly and efficiently broke down the perchlorate in water using hydrogen gas at room temperature with no combustion involved.\u201cThis catalyst is much more active than any other chemical catalyst reported to date and reduces more than 99.99% of the perchlorate into chloride regardless of the initial perchlorate concentration,\u201d Ren said.The new catalyst reduces perchlorate in a wide concentration range, from less than 1 milligram per liter to 10 grams per liter. This makes it suitable for use in various scenarios, including remediating contaminated groundwater, treating heavily contaminated wastewater from explosives manufacturing, and making Mars habitable.\u201cA convenient catalytic reduction system may help harvest oxygen gas from perchlorate washed from the Martian soil when the catalyst is coupled with other processes,\u201d Liu said.The paper, \u201cA bioinspired molybdenum catalyst for aqueous perchlorate reduction,\u201d was published in the Journal of the American Chemical Society. Ren and Liu were joined in the research by UC Riverside doctoral student Jinyu Gao, undergraduate student Jacob Palmer, and high school student Eric Y. Bi. Peng Yang and Mengqiang Zhu at the University of Wyoming characterized the catalyst with X-ray absorption spectroscopies and Ohio State University\u2019s Jiaonan Sun and Yiying Wu performed the electrochemical testing. The research was funded by the National Science Foundation.Header photo:\u00a0Camille Brodard on UnsplashShare this ArticleMedia ContactsTagsBourns College Of EngineeringDepartment Of Chemical And Environmental EngineeringWater ContaminationWater Treatmentspace travelJinyong LiuScience / TechnologyRelated ArticlesScience / TechnologyStudy of perception and memory in older adults will improve understanding of dementiasScience / TechnologyUCR joins forces with NASA on missions to VenusScience / TechnologyA new dimension in the quest to understand dark matter Science / Technology$3 million grant aims to prolong life for dialysis patientsSearchUniversity of California, Riverside900 University Ave.            Riverside, CA 92521Tel: 951 827-1012UCR LibraryCampus StatusCampus StoreCareer OpportunitiesDiversityMaps and DirectionsVisit UCRUniversity of California, Riverside             900 University Ave.            Riverside, CA 92521                          tel: 951 827-0000                        email: webmaster@ucr.edu  Find UsFollow US:Related LinksUCR News ArchiveScience TodayServicio de Informaci\u00f3n en Espa\u00f1olUC Agricultural and Natural Resources newsUC NewsroomAvailable FeedsCreator State PodcastPrivacy PolicyTerms and Conditions\u00a9 2021 Regents of the University of CaliforniaSearch\u00d7Let us help you with your searchEnter your Search Criteria.Search All UCRSearch This SiteCancel"}, {"id": 45, "url": "https://insideucr.ucr.edu/stories/2021/06/02/poor-air-quality-and-warehouses-linked-inland-empire-covid-19-inequities/", "html": "COVID-19\u00a0information, guidance, and resources.

Members of environmental justice communities experiencing racialized poverty, classified as essential workers and thus not able to shelter in place at home, and living in a region with some of the worst air quality in the country, have borne the brunt of it,\u201d said Jade Sasser, an associate professor of gender & sexuality studies and lead author. \u201cWe wanted to make an intervention by raising awareness of the inequities right here in our own communities.\u201d A map showing how Latino population density, poor air quality, and Covid-19 overlap in the Inland Empire. Sasser et. al., 2021Covid-19 has hit many Black and Latino communities especially hard, but few interventions target the overlapping forms of inequality that make these communities more vulnerable in the first place. The authors call for a regulatory infrastructure that maintains safety protocols in workplaces that disproportionately expose communities of color and the poor to highly transmissible diseases like Covid-19.\u00a0They also recommend environmental health scientists characterize the exposome in homes and workplaces of the most severely affected populations during the Covid-19 crisis, such as essential workers, and build databases of exposure data at the individual level that can be mined for predictive and mitigation purposes.\u00a0\u201cWe now have the technology and connectivity to build these databases, which helps mitigate real-time exposure for people who may not be aware of their day-to-day air pollution exposure risks,\u201d said Sunni Ivey, an assistant professor of chemical and environmental engineering whose work focuses on modeling air quality.One area in particular need of attention is the link between air quality and susceptibility to Covid-19. Using data from California OEHHA CalEnviroScreen database in the Inland Empire region of southern California, which consists of Riverside and San Bernardino Counties, the authors show that areas with especially large numbers of Covid-19 cases are also predominantly Latino and have very high environmental vulnerability scores caused by air pollution from trucks associated with the numerous warehouses in these neighborhoods, among other factors.\u00a0The Inland Empire has long had notoriously poor air quality because natural air currents bring gaseous pollutants and particulate matter from the Los Angeles area while the warehousing and logistics boom has potentially increased emissions from diesel trucks and trains. Inhaling traffic-related pollutants like diesel particulate matter makes people more susceptible to a range of respiratory health problems. The authors cite a recent study that showed that small increases in particulate matter translate to an 11% increase in the Covid-19 death rate.\u201cResearch shows that inhalation exposure to fine particles and other pollutants leads to increased inflammation in the lungs and the development of asthma. We need more information on the interaction between respiratory health and COVID-19 severity,\u201d said Ivey.Many of the people living in Inland Empire communities devastated by Covid-19 also work in these warehouses and other essential occupations. They face the double jeopardy of greater vulnerability due to poor air quality and of workplace exposure. Many also have low wages and inadequate healthcare. The authors call for research into interventions that acknowledge and address the intersectional nature of Covid-19 inequities.Sasser and Ivey were joined in the research by Bronwyn Leebaw, Brandon Brown, Chikako Takeshita, and Alexander Nguyen, all of whom are at UC Riverside. The open access commentary, \u201cIntersectional perspectives on COVID-19 exposure,\u201d is published in the Journal of Exposure Science & Environmental Epidemiology and available here.\u00a0Share this StoryTagsResearch Bloginland empireCOVID-19environmental justiceRelated StoriesHow UCR created a successful COVID-19 testing programAlgorithm helps speed up simulation of vast, complex universesStudy helps explain how shingles vaccination coverage differs among social groupsFAQ on UCs proposed COVID-19 vaccination policySearchUniversity of California, Riverside900 University Ave.            Riverside, CA 92521Tel: 951 827-1012UCR LibraryCampus StatusCampus StoreCareer OpportunitiesDiversityMaps and DirectionsVisit UCRUniversity of California, Riverside             900 University Ave.            Riverside, CA 92521                          tel: 951 827-0000                        email: webmaster@ucr.edu  Find UsFollow US:Related LinksUCR NewsResearch BlogInside UCR ArchiveHuman ResourcesUC Path PortalStaff AssemblyUC NewsroomPrivacy PolicyTerms and Conditions\u00a9 2021 Regents of the University of CaliforniaSearch\u00d7Let us help you with your searchEnter your Search Criteria.Search All UCRSearch This SiteCancel"}, {"id": 46, "url": "https://www.engr.ucr.edu/news/2021/05/26/79000-raised-professor-emeritus-tom-paynes-79th-birthday/", "html": "Access BCOE COVID-19 information and guidance.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Submit a return-to-work proposal.\u00a0 \u00a0Request a one-time visit to BCOE.\u00a0 Take the daily wellness check survey.Skip to main contentMarlan and Rosemary Bourns College of EngineeringBCOE Departments & ProgramsMARLAN AND ROSEMARY BOURNS COLLEGE OF ENGINEERINGBioengineeringChemical and Environmental EngineeringComputer EngineeringComputer Science and EngineeringData ScienceElectrical and Computer EngineeringMaterials Science and EngineeringMechanical EngineernigOnline M.S. in EngineeringSearchUC Riverside Marlan and Rosemary Bourns College of Engineering Celebrating 30 YearsSearchStudentsProspective UndergradWhy BCOE?Majors & Programs TransferScholarshipsMeet AlumniApply NowProspective GraduateApply NowVisit BCOECurrent StudentsBS + MS ProgramUCR Education Abroad OfficeUndergrad researchAdvisingTransfer centerCampus resourcesSchool calendarStudent NewslettersResearchResearch CapabilitiesResearch centersUndergraduate ResearchFacilitiesUser FacilitiesMSE User FacilitiesNanofabrication FacilityMachine Shop Central Facility for Advanced Microscopy and MicroanalysisParentsBCOE BoostersNew Parent FAQsPartnersIndustry PartnersME CO-OP ProgramDeans innovation fundCouncil of AdvisorsMake a giftAlumniAlumniMentorRecruitMake a giftAboutMessage from the deanCollege leadership Departments and ProgramsBioengineeringChemical & Environmental EngineeringComputer EngineeringComputer Science & EngineeringElectrical & Computer EngineeringMasters in Engineering OnlineMaterials Science & EngineeringMechanical EngineeringPeopleEmploymentNewsEventsContact usStudentsProspective UndergradWhy BCOE?Majors & Programs TransferScholarshipsMeet AlumniApply NowProspective GraduateApply NowVisit BCOECurrent StudentsBS + MS ProgramUCR Education Abroad OfficeUndergrad researchAdvisingTransfer centerCampus resourcesSchool calendarStudent NewslettersResearchResearch CapabilitiesResearch centersUndergraduate ResearchFacilitiesUser FacilitiesMSE User FacilitiesNanofabrication FacilityMachine Shop Central Facility for Advanced Microscopy and MicroanalysisParentsBCOE BoostersNew Parent FAQsPartnersIndustry PartnersME CO-OP ProgramDeans innovation fundCouncil of AdvisorsMake a giftAlumniAlumniMentorRecruitMake a giftAboutMessage from the deanCollege leadership BioengineeringChemical & Environmental EngineeringComputer EngineeringComputer Science & EngineeringElectrical & Computer EngineeringMasters in Engineering OnlineMaterials Science & EngineeringMechanical EngineeringPeopleEmploymentNewsEventsContact usBCOE Departments & ProgramsMARLAN AND ROSEMARY BOURNS COLLEGE OF ENGINEERINGBioengineeringChemical and Environmental EngineeringComputer EngineeringComputer Science and EngineeringData ScienceElectrical and Computer EngineeringMaterials Science and EngineeringMechanical EngineernigOnline M.S. in EngineeringBreadcrumbLatest NewsMay 26th, 2021$79,000 raised for Professor Emeritus Tom Payne\u2019s 79th birthday $79,000 raised for Professor Emeritus Tom Payne\u2019s 79th birthdayMay 26, 2021 In April 2013, the Thomas H. Payne Scholarship in Computer Science was established with gifts from Professor Paynes former students, colleagues, friends and family. Nearly a decade later in 2021, and just in time for Professor Payne\u2019s 79th birthday, the fund has grown to $79,079. The fund was established to support undergraduate students in computer science.\u201cIt was both humbling and exciting when I learned we had reached the $79,000 goal for the scholarship,\u201d said Professor Payne. \u201cHumbling because it is an honor to be remembered by my former students, colleagues, and friends, and exciting to see how willing they are to help the next generation of students in computer science.\u201dThomas H. Payne received a Ph.D. in Mathematics from the University of Notre Dame in 1967. As a young man, Payne began a career at UC Riverside that would span over five decades. In his time at UCR, he frequently taught the CS10, 11, 12 entry series and upper-division course on compilers CS152 and on operating systems CS153. His research focused on areas of computing and formal logic, including computability theory and set theory.\u00a0 Professor Thomas PaynePayne saw the creation of the Bourns College of Engineering in the early 1990s, served as department chair from 1994 to 1999 and again from 2002 to 2007, during which time he was instrumental in the growth of the Computer Science and Engineering department. Since then, the department has become the largest engineering department at the college and is top\u2014ranked by CSRankings in multiple categories: 6th in High Performance Computing, 7th in Design Automation, 12th in Computational Bio and Bioinformatics, and 15th in Systems category overall.\u00a0Payne is well-known for being a trusted faculty member, mentor and friend to countless students and colleagues. He was more than a professor to thousands of students; he influenced and inspired them beyond the classroom. As former students said in a special video dedicated to Payne:\u201cYou are one of those professors; I can still remember not only all your terrific lectures, but also our discussions outside the classroom,\u201d said Brian Hawley, 1990 B.S. and 1991 M.S. in Computer Science.\u201cThank you for being the leader, the voice, and the storyteller, the person that helps explain why things are the way they are,\u201d said Titus Winters, 2004 M.S. and 2006 Ph.D. in Computer Science.With the creation of the scholarship, Payne continues to inspire BCOE\u2019s computer science students.\u201cIt\u2019s more than just the scholarship, it\u2019s more of a recognition,\u201d said Lucca Psaila, a fourth-year computer science undergraduate student and recipient of the Thomas Payne scholarship. \u201cYou have shown students like me that we\u2019re appreciated and acknowledged for the things that we do and the accomplishments we make. It allows me to continue on knowing that people are paying attention.\u201dIn a thank you message to the scholarship committee, Psaila continued that receiving the scholarship has inspired him to pay it forward after graduating, saying, \u201cI know one of the first things I\u2019m going to do: give back to my school and help other students who are in my previous situation.\u201dIf you\u2019d like to contribute to the Thomas Payne Scholarship in Computer Science, visit: https://crowdfunding.ucr.edu/o/university-of-california-riverside/i/ucrcrowdfunding/s/happy-birthday-thpShare ThisMore NewsSearchUniversity of California, Riverside900 University Ave.            Riverside, CA 92521Tel: 951 827-1012UCR LibraryCampus StatusCampus StoreCareer OpportunitiesDiversityMaps and DirectionsVisit UCRMarlan and Rosemary Bourns College of Engineering             446 Winston Chung Hall            900 University Ave.             Riverside, CA 92521              tel: 951 827-5190                 fax: 951 827-3188         email: news@engr.ucr.edu Related LinksBCOE Available Conference Rooms and Technology ResourcesGive to BournsIntranetFaculty ResourcesMarketing ResourcesSystemsFollow US:Visit BCOEs Facebook page external site: FacebookFollow BCOE on Twitter external site: TwitterVisit BCOEs YouTube channel external site: YouTubeVisit BCOEs Flickr gallery external site: FlickrSubscribe to BCOE News via RSS FeedPrivacy PolicyTerms and Conditions\u00a9 2021 Regents of the University of California\u00d7Let us help you with your searchEnter your Search Criteria.Search All UCRSearch This SiteCancel"}, {"id": 47, "url": "https://news.ucr.edu/articles/2021/05/25/uc-riverside-offers-uc-systems-first-masters-degree-robotics/", "html": "COVID-19\u00a0information, guidance, and resources.

Applications for fall 2021 admission are due by July 15 for international students, and by Sept. 1 for domestic students.The master\u2019s in Robotics provides interdisciplinary training in the design, construction, and deployment of robots and autonomous systems. Students will learn the foundational principles underlying mechanical and electronic aspects of robot design, control and navigation of robots, and artificial intelligence required for robots to perceive their surroundings and make decisions.\u201cThis exciting new program will help meet the growing need in the global workforce for robotics engineers and afford students both the breadth and depth of knowledge to excel in these lucrative science careers,\u201d said Amit Roy Chowdhury, professor of electrical and computer engineering and chair of the robotics degree program starting July 1, 2021. \u201cBy learning the latest theories from leading faculty experts in their field, students will be well prepared to address tomorrow\u2019s engineering challenges in artificial intelligence, computing, and more.\u201d \u00a0\u00a0The program brings under one umbrella popular courses in robotics currently offered in different departments. For example, Mechanical Engineering offers courses in robot design and control, Electrical and Computer Engineering, in control and machine learning, Computer Engineering, in real-time system design, and Computer Science and Engineering, in machine learning and data mining. The new degree allows students access to a curriculum that will provide a holistic understanding of robotics and deeper understanding of specialized aspects that correspond to their interests.Robotics deals with the design and operation of robots, which includes mechanical, electronic and computer design, as well as software systems that are capable of processing sensory inputs, reasoning about the operational environment, and making decisions about future operations. Advances in artificial intelligence research and technology development have driven rapid interest in robotics. Application areas include manufacturing, logistics, health care, public safety, and the military.One area of particular focus for the program will be algorithmic bias in artificial intelligence, or AI, and machine learning. The design of AI systems has been primarily the domain of white, male engineers, and UC Riverside will make an effort to recruit more diverse and inclusive robotics students. The program will also work closely with the computer science and electrical and computer engineering departments to address algorithmic bias, including how biased versus unbiased robots may harm society as the technology evolves.Students will be encouraged to participate with ongoing efforts at UCR to provide mentorship and broaden participation in robotics-related activities, such as UCR\u2019s K-12 Lego Robotics Competition. The robotics program will work with BCOE student organizations to create new opportunities for graduate student leadership and participation surrounding community outreach events.The program is jointly managed by the computer science and engineering, electrical and computer engineering, and mechanical engineering departments.To apply for the robotics program, visit https://robotics.engr.ucr.edu.\u00a0Share this ArticleMedia ContactsTagsBourns College Of EngineeringroboticsDepartment Of Electrical And Computer EngineeringDepartment of Mechanical EngineeringDepartment Of Computer Science And EngineeringScience / TechnologyRelated ArticlesScience / TechnologyStudy of perception and memory in older adults will improve understanding of dementiasScience / TechnologyUCR joins forces with NASA on missions to VenusScience / TechnologyA new water treatment technology could also help Mars explorersScience / TechnologyA new dimension in the quest to understand dark matter SearchUniversity of California, Riverside900 University Ave.            Riverside, CA 92521Tel: 951 827-1012UCR LibraryCampus StatusCampus StoreCareer OpportunitiesDiversityMaps and DirectionsVisit UCRUniversity of California, Riverside             900 University Ave.            Riverside, CA 92521                          tel: 951 827-0000                        email: webmaster@ucr.edu  Find UsFollow US:Related LinksUCR News ArchiveScience TodayServicio de Informaci\u00f3n en Espa\u00f1olUC Agricultural and Natural Resources newsUC NewsroomAvailable FeedsCreator State PodcastPrivacy PolicyTerms and Conditions\u00a9 2021 Regents of the University of CaliforniaSearch\u00d7Let us help you with your searchEnter your Search Criteria.Search All UCRSearch This SiteCancel"}, {"id": 48, "url": "https://news.ucr.edu/articles/2021/05/24/tiny-tomatoes-could-mean-big-profits-urban-agriculture/", "html": "COVID-19\u00a0information, guidance, and resources.

Tiny tomatoes suitable for vertical farming developed using CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing  technology at UC Riverside. Robert Jinkerson/UCRJinkerson has received a $450,000 New Innovator grant from the Foundation for Food & Agriculture Research, or FFAR, to advance this research. FFAR\u2019s New Innovator in Food & Agriculture Research Award provides early career scientists with funding to conduct audacious food and agriculture research.\u00a0By 2050, there will be nine billion people on the planet, but arable land is decreasing. Global food production will need to double to meet food needs, though climate change complicates the problem more.\u00a0\u201cUrban controlled environment agriculture can offer many benefits for the production of crops and is likely to supply more food in the future as worldwide food demand increases,\u201d Jinkerson said.Often these urban CEA systems are designed to have plant growth areas stacked vertically to save space. However, this also decreases the height available for plant growth, limiting the size of crops that can be cultivated in vertical farms to small leafy greens.\u201cIn order to overcome these size limitations and to increase the variety of crops that can be grown in vertical farms, we are engineering tomato plants to have a small stature and are optimized for this unique growing environment,\u201d said Jinkerson, who uses CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing to modulate key genes involved in plant development and architecture.\u00a0In addition to reducing the size of plants, this project will also increase the nutritional value of these crops by increasing their vitamin content, making urban agriculture more profitable.The potential applications for these tiny tomatoes don\u2019t end on Earth.Jinkerson, along with Martha Orozco-C\u00e1rdenas, director of the UCR Plant Transformation Research Center, have been awarded a NASA Space Biology grant to evaluate tomatoes from their prior work on the International Space Station. These plants, also engineered with gene editing technology and dubbed Small Plants for Agriculture in Controlled Environments, or SPACE tomatoes, will be grown in the Advanced Plant Habitat onboard the ISS to determine how these plants grow in microgravity. The SPACE tomatoes will be grown \u2018seed-to-seed,\u2019 meaning seeds will be harvested and the next generation grown in space, completing an entire lifecycle. These experiments, which will happen after several years of trials on Earth, will help establish methodologies to grow food on long duration space missions.\u201cWe are extremely excited to receive support for these projects and hope that the results will help transform the way we produce food here on Earth and beyond,\u201d said Jinkerson.Share this ArticleMedia ContactsTagsBourns College Of EngineeringDepartment Of Chemical And Environmental EngineeringRobert JinkersonfoodtomatoesScience / TechnologyRelated ArticlesScience / TechnologyStudy of perception and memory in older adults will improve understanding of dementiasScience / TechnologyUCR joins forces with NASA on missions to VenusScience / TechnologyA new water treatment technology could also help Mars explorersScience / TechnologyA new dimension in the quest to understand dark matter SearchUniversity of California, Riverside900 University Ave.            Riverside, CA 92521Tel: 951 827-1012UCR LibraryCampus StatusCampus StoreCareer OpportunitiesDiversityMaps and DirectionsVisit UCRUniversity of California, Riverside             900 University Ave.            Riverside, CA 92521                          tel: 951 827-0000                        email: webmaster@ucr.edu  Find UsFollow US:Related LinksUCR News ArchiveScience TodayServicio de Informaci\u00f3n en Espa\u00f1olUC Agricultural and Natural Resources newsUC NewsroomAvailable FeedsCreator State PodcastPrivacy PolicyTerms and Conditions\u00a9 2021 Regents of the University of CaliforniaSearch\u00d7Let us help you with your searchEnter your Search Criteria.Search All UCRSearch This SiteCancel"}, {"id": 49, "url": "https://news.ucr.edu/articles/2021/05/21/implantable-piezoelectric-polymer-improves-controlled-release-drugs/", "html": "COVID-19\u00a0information, guidance, and resources.

An implantable piezoelectric polymer nanofiber device that releases controlled amounts of a drug under mechanical force. Jin Nam/UCRThe drawbacks of conventional drug administration include repeated administration, nonspecific biodistribution in the body\u2019s systems, the long-term unsustainability of drug molecules, and high cytotoxicity, posing a challenge for the efficient treatment of chronic diseases that require varying drug dosages over time for optimal therapeutic efficacy. Most controlled release methods encapsulate drug particles in biodegradable, bubble-like containers that dissolve over time to release the drug, making it difficult to deliver drugs on a schedule. Others involve a battery-powered device that is not biocompatible.Jin Nam, an associate professor of bioengineering in UC Riverside\u2019s Marlan and Rosemary Bourns College of Engineering, runs a lab that works with biocompatible polymers to build frameworks known as scaffolds that help stem cells repair tissues and organs. One of these polymers, polyvinylidene fluoride-trifluro-ethylene, or PVDF-TrFE, can produce an electrical charge under mechanical stress. Nam realized this property, known as piezoelectricity, made the polymer a potentially viable candidate for a drug release system.His team used a technique called electrospinning to produce PVDF-TrFE nanofibers layered in a thin mat. Structuring the material in nanoscale by electrospinning optimized the sensitivity of the resulting nanofibers so the drug delivery system would respond to physiologically safe magnitudes of force while remaining insensitive to daily activities. The large surface area of the nanofibers allowed them to adsorb a relatively large quantity of drug molecules.\u00a0After embedding the film in a hydrogel that mimics living tissue, a series of tests using therapeutic shockwaves generated enough electric charge to release an electrostatically attached model drug molecule into the surrounding gel. The researchers could tune the drug release quantity by varying the applied pressure and duration.\u201cThis piezoelectric nanofiber-based drug delivery system enables localized delivery of drug molecules on demand, which would be useful for diseases or conditions that require long-term, repeated drug administration, such as cancer treatments,\u201d Nam said. \u201cThe large surface area-to-volume ratio of nanofibrous structure enables a greater drug loading, leading to a single injection or implantation that lasts longer than conventional drug delivery.\u201dCompared to traditional drug delivery systems based on degradation or diffusion release that typically show an initial burst release followed by different rates of release, the linear profile of drug release from the piezoelectric-based system allows for the precise administration of drug molecules regardless of implantation duration. Repeated on-demand drug release tests showed a similar amount of drug release per activation, confirming the robust control of release rate.\u00a0The sensitivity of the drug release kinetics can be tuned by controlling the nanofiber size to a range that is activated by therapeutic shockwaves, often used for musculoskeletal pain treatment with a handheld device. Smaller, more sensitive nanofiber sizes can be utilized for implantation in deep tissues, such as near a bone under muscles, while less sensitive larger nanofibers could find use in subcutaneous applications to avoid false activation by accidental impact.\u00a0Nam was joined in the research by Tanvi Jariwala, Gerardo Ico, Youyi Tai, Honghyun Park, and Nosang V. Myung. The paper, \u201cMechano-responsive piezoelectric nanofiber as an on-demand drug delivery vehicle,\u201d is available here.\u00a0Header photo: Chemotherapy drugs and an IV bottle.

18th, 2021UCR computer scientist earns NSF CAREER award to combat online misinformation and unlock the mystery of black holes  UCR computer scientist earns NSF CAREER award to combat online misinformation and unlock the mystery of black holes May 18, 2021 Assistant professor of computer science Evangelos Papalexakis at the Marlan and Rosemary Bourns College of Engineering BCOE has been awarded the prestigious National Science Foundation NSF CAREER Award on autonomous tensor analysis towards actionable insights from raw multi-aspect data, with applications for detecting misinformation online and detecting gravitational waves.\u201cI am very grateful for the generous support of NSF, which will allow my research group to focus and work on those ideas long-term,\u201d said Papalexakis. \u201cI am also extremely grateful for all the work done by my students and collaborators which laid the foundations for the proposed work and made all of this possible.\u201d\u00a0 Evangelos PapalexakisPapalexakis\u2019 research is largely focused on tensor decompositions for machine learning and data science. When applied to the real-world, it can improve computers\u2019 detection of what content is accurate versus what we would call \u201cfake news.\u201dWhen algorithms assess whether or not an article is trustworthy, they analyze multiple data points such as the text, images, author, publication date, and number of times it has been shared on social media.This type of analysis, called current tensor analysis, can be effective and powerful. Unfortunately, this approach is labor-intensive: requiring lots of trial-and-error tuning, familiarity with tensor methods, and domain expertise in the target application. Because of these barriers, practitioners do not widely use this method.The solution, as Papalexakis sees it, and the goal of this five-year NSF-funded award, is to democratize unsupervised exploratory tensor analysis \u2013 making it more accessible while producing actionable insights from the data. While other projects in meta-learning have been focused on automating supervised models, Papalexakis\u2019 project has the potential to create a new field of unsupervised exploratory meta-learning. This is the first task of the project.The second task will focus on real-world collaboration with domain experts in two distinct yet related scientific areas: in the web and in the cosmos. While the project will provide earth-bound tools to better judge the trustworthiness of news online, it also has out-of-this world implications. New findings could help scientists understand cosmic objects that do not emit light, commonly known as black holes, helping us unravel current mysteries of the universe.Papalexakis plans to integrate this research into undergraduate and graduate Data Science curricula, which is a newly offered undergraduate major at UCR, mentor undergraduate students from underrepresented groups, and organize summer workshops for local school districts to broaden Data Science in high school education.NSF CAREER Awards are awarded to assistant professors\u00a0to fund research that is expected to form a firm foundation for a lifetime of leadership in integrating education and research.Share ThisMore NewsSearchUniversity of California, Riverside900 University Ave.            Riverside, CA 92521Tel: 951 827-1012UCR LibraryCampus StatusCampus StoreCareer OpportunitiesDiversityMaps and DirectionsVisit UCRMarlan and Rosemary Bourns College of Engineering             446 Winston Chung Hall            900 University Ave.             Riverside, CA 92521              tel: 951 827-5190                 fax: 951 827-3188         email: news@engr.ucr.edu Related LinksBCOE Available Conference Rooms and Technology ResourcesGive to BournsIntranetFaculty ResourcesMarketing ResourcesSystemsFollow US:Visit BCOEs Facebook page external site: FacebookFollow BCOE on Twitter external site: TwitterVisit BCOEs YouTube channel external site: YouTubeVisit BCOEs Flickr gallery external site: FlickrSubscribe to BCOE News via RSS FeedPrivacy PolicyTerms and Conditions\u00a9 2021 Regents of the University of California\u00d7Let us help you with your searchEnter your Search Criteria.Search All UCRSearch This SiteCancel"}, {"id": 52, "url": "https://news.ucr.edu/articles/2021/05/17/nanofiber-filter-captures-almost-100-coronavirus-aerosols/", "html": "COVID-19\u00a0information, guidance, and resources.

The cotton mask and neck gaiter only removed about 45%-73% of the aerosols. The surgical mask did much better, removing 98% of coronavirus aerosols. But the nanofiber filter removed almost all of the coronavirus aerosols.\u00a0 Left: A nanofiber filter that captures 99.9% of coronavirus aerosols; Right: A highly magnified image of the polymer nanofibers. Photo: Yun ShenThe World Health Organization and Centers for Disease Control have both recognized aerosols as a major mechanism of COVID-19 virus transmission. Aerosols are tiny particles of water or other matter that can remain suspended in air for long periods of time and are small enough to penetrate the respiratory system.\u00a0People release aerosols whenever they breathe, cough, talk, shout, or sing. If they are infected with COVID-19, these aerosols can also contain the virus. Inhaling a sufficient quantity of coronavirus-laden aerosols can make people sick. Efforts to curb aerosol spread of COVID-19 focus on minimizing individual exposure and reducing the overall quantity of aerosols in an environment by asking people to wear masks and by improving indoor ventilation and air filtration systems.\u00a0Studying a contagious new virus is dangerous and done in labs with the highest biosecurity ratings, which are relatively rare. To date, all studies during the pandemic on mask or filter efficiency have used other materials thought to mimic the size and behavior of coronavirus aerosols. The new study improved on this by testing both aerosolized saline solution and an aerosol that contained a coronavirus in the same family as the virus that causes COVID-19, but only infects mice.\u00a0Shen and George Washington University colleague Danmeng Shuai produced a nanofiber filter by sending a high electrical voltage through a drop of liquid polyvinylidene fluoride to spin threads about 300 nanometers in diameter \u2014 about 167 times thinner than a human hair. The process created pores only a couple of micrometers in diameter on the nanofiber\u2019s surfaces, which helped them capture 99.9% of coronavirus aerosols.\u00a0The production technique, known as electrospinning, is cost effective and could be used to mass produce nanofiber filters for personal protective equipment and air filtration systems. Electrospinning also leaves the nanofibers with an electrostatic charge that enhances their ability to capture aerosols, and their high porosity makes it easier to breathe wearing electrospun nanofiber filters.\u201cElectrospinning can advance the design and fabrication of face masks and air filters,\u201d said Shen. \u201cDeveloping new masks and air filters by electrospinning is promising because of its high performance in filtration, economic feasibility, and scalability, and it can meet on-site needs of the masks and air filters.\u201dThe paper, \u201cDevelopment of electrospun nanofibrous filters for controlling coronavirus aerosols,\u201d is published in Environmental Science & Technology Letters.

UC Riverside engineers are solving this problem by vaporizing metals within a magnetic field to direct the reassembly of metal atoms into predictable shapes. The research is published in The Journal of Physical Chemistry Letters. Image showing the stringlike particles formed by iron and nickel and the more globular clusters formed by copper. Abbaschian, Zachariah, et. al. 2021Nanomaterials, which are made of particles measuring 1-100 nanometers, are typically created within a liquid matrix, which is expensive for bulk production applications, and in many cases cannot make pure metals, such as aluminum or magnesium. More economical production techniquess typically involve vapor phase approaches to create a cloud of particles condensing from the vapor. These suffer from a lack of control. \u00a0Reza Abbaschian, a distinguished professor of mechanical engineering; and Michael Zachariah, a distinguished professor of chemical and environmental engineering at UC Riverside\u2019s Marlan and Rosemary Bourns College of Engineering; joined forces to create nanomaterials from iron, copper, and nickel in a gas phase. They placed solid metal within a powerful electromagnetic levitation coil to heat the metal beyond its melting point, vaporizing it. The metal droplets levitated in the gas within the coil and moved in directions determined by their inherent reactions to magnetic forces. When the droplets bonded, they did so in an orderly fashion that the researchers learned they could predict based on the type of metal and how and where they applied the magnetic fields.Iron and nickel nanoparticles formed string-like aggregates while copper nanoparticles formed globular clusters. When deposited on a carbon film, iron and nickel aggregates gave the film a porous surface, while carbon aggregates gave it a more compact, solid surface. The qualities of the materials on the carbon film mirrored at larger scale the properties of each type of nanoparticle.Because the field can be thought of as an \u201cadd-on,\u201d this approach could be applied to any vapor-phase nanoparticle generation source where the structure is important, such as fillers used in polymer composites for magnetic shielding, or to improve electrical or mechanical properties.\u201cThis \u2018field directed\u2019 approach enables one to manipulate the assembly process and change the architecture of the resulting particles from high fractal dimension objects to lower dimension string-like structures.

The violence that has recently taken the lives of George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor, Nina Pop, and countless others, are just the latest examples of unacceptable attacks on our Black citizens. We all have the same rights under law, but not in practice.\u00a0This must change now.Each of these deaths is tragic. Combined, they display a disturbing pattern of violence that stems from institutionalized racism in many of our workplaces, communities, and even our educational systems. These deaths, and the many that came before them, are abhorrent and the institutional protections of those committing these crimes must be removed and the criminals prosecuted. Calling out institutional racism is not enough.\u00a0Every institution must reevaluate its own culture and identify ways to make positive change.UC Riverside and BCOE have suffered from racial and gender bias. Over the past few weeks, Black students have shared racist experiences both on and off campus and Black faculty and staff have shared their pain in light of recent protests. Years of work groups, task forces, and diversity initiatives have repeatedly identified the same problems, and each has fallen short, resulting in a new committee identifying the same problems every few years. As an institution that creates future leaders, we need to do more to support Black members of our community in this moment of national crisis and moving forward. It is on every one of us not to tolerate racism on any level and to contribute to a culture and environment that welcomes and supports all students, staff, and faculty equally.We acknowledge that everyone within our BCOE community has been significantly impacted by the recent events. Understandably, our students have found it difficult to focus on coursework when a historic movement so many years in the making has been, in some cases, taking place right outside their homes and in their neighborhoods. We recognize and fully support our students who are lending their voices for change.\u00a0We implore every member of the BCOE community to commit to zero tolerance of racism of any kind. We call on the BCOE community to commit to the following actions as the first steps to ensuring BCOE is a safe, inclusive, and equitable community for our Black engineers:Speak up and speak out. As a community, we cannot tolerate racist rhetoric, institutional bias, or acts of violence. This is not a political statement.\u00a0This is human decency.Reevaluate recruitment, retention, and graduation rates annually and ensure our Black BCOE students have equitable access and support in their engineering education. We commit to working with our Black students to identify areas in need of improvement within our college as well as collecting recommendations from our students, faculty, staff, and local community to ensure a supportive community.Set the standard of acceptance. Our students have asked for training for all BCOE community members, including at new student orientations, new faculty orientations, and staff onboarding procedures to train employees and peers on working with Black audiences. BCOE commits to providing this training to set the standard for appropriate and inclusive behavior by both employees and student peers.Evaluate our K-12 outreach effort to enhance Black student opportunities. BCOE has been making efforts to increase the numbers of young Black scholars pursuing careers in engineering with insufficient success. We know we need to do better.\u00a0 By continually reviewing our outreach strategy, BCOE will work to ensure Black communities are engaged and will continue working in partnership with student organization leaders to develop meaningful programs.Continue working to establish partnerships with Historically Black Colleges and Universities HBCUs. When it comes to Black student enrollment at BCOE, we fall short. Building partnerships with HBCUs will strengthen the overall student experience and recruitment from these institutions will increase graduate enrollment of Black students in engineering at BCOE.Continue working to hire more Black faculty and staff. As the college continues to grow, we must do more to recruit and retain Black faculty and staff and remove the systemic barriers that breed bias, racism, and prejudice in the hiring process. Black students have recommended the hiring of Black faculty, advisors, and counselors to create a community where they are heard, understood, and supported.Create an open dialogue. On June 3, we held the first of what will be quarterly student organization leader calls with college administration to discuss challenges our student groups are facing. Feedback from these conversations will allow us to modify, pause, or strengthen programs and to grow the inclusiveness of our college culture. Enhance the Equity Advisor role. We must take this time to both redefine and expand upon the role of the college\u2019s equity advisor. In addition to developing a more purposeful mission for this role that helps support the Black engineering community, the college\u2019s equity advisor must be empowered to ensure the successful delivery of these initiatives.\u00a0\u00a0Develop scholarship pathways dedicated toward supporting Black engineers. In the coming months, we expect to complete our fundraising goal for UCR\u2019s first-ever student organization endowed fund. The NSBE Endowment Fund was launched earlier this year and was established in partnership with the Council for the Advancement of Black Engineers CABE and the National Society of Black Engineers NSBE. We are more than half-way to the $25,000 fundraising goal for an endowment that will support our NSBE students. Once we have reached our goal, we will expand upon this effort to create additional scholarship opportunities.Eliminating institutionalized racism is a complex challenge. One that requires transformative approaches to enact a change that is long overdue. We call on the BCOE community to recommit to ensuring we have an inclusive environment by holding each other accountable.Our students, staff, and faculty have endured immense hardship through this quarter \u2013 the isolation of quarantine, feeling worried about the health of family and friends, the stress of curfews, and now the level of effort needed to bring about real, long-term societal change.\u00a0This has been especially challenging for our students who are seeking a degree in one of the most challenging fields of study. It is on us as staff and faculty to support our students who will go on to define our future not just technologically but socially. UCR and BCOE students, we hear you. You have our support. We will emerge from this a stronger community and work together to achieve real change.\u00a0On behalf of the Marlan and Rosemary Bourns College of Engineering,Christopher S.

The Vannevar Bush Faculty Fellowship will help Balandin\u2019s group create a new comprehensive research field of one-dimensional quantum materials. The project\u2019s focus is on quantum phenomena that reveal themselves in this unique class of materials.\u00a0Balandin\u2019s expertise and research interests cover a broad range, from solid-state physics theory to experimental investigation of advanced materials and fabrication of nano-devices with applications in electronics and energy conversion. His research group is internationally recognized for pioneering studies of graphene\u2019s thermal properties, discovery of unique features of phonon thermal transport in two-dimensional materials, and the first proposals and demonstrations of practical applications of graphene in thermal management of electronics.To give an example of the kind of innovative work that motivated the new research direction, the group recently published the details of a flexible polymer film filled with needle-like, quasi-one-dimensional threads that combines excellent electromagnetic shielding with ease of manufacture. Electromagnetic shielding prevents radio frequency interference in sensitive electronics.For the Vannevar Bush Faculty Fellowship project, Balandin and co-workers will investigate formation of charge-density-wave condensate in one-dimensional Van der Waals materials. Other topics of interest include one-dimensional materials with strong spin-orbit coupling, phonon confinement, and quantization effects.\u00a0The Vannevar Bush Faculty Fellowship is the Department of Defense\u2019s most prestigious single-investigator award and supports new, out-of-the box ideas where researcher creativity intersects with the unknown.Share this ArticleMedia ContactsTagsBourns College Of EngineeringDepartment Of Electrical And Computer Engineeringmaterials science and engineeringAlexander BalandinNanomaterialsScience / TechnologyRelated ArticlesScience / TechnologyStudy of perception and memory in older adults will improve understanding of dementiasScience / TechnologyA new water treatment technology could also help Mars explorersScience / TechnologyUCR joins forces with NASA on missions to VenusScience / TechnologyA new dimension in the quest to understand dark matter SearchUniversity of California, Riverside900 University Ave.            Riverside, CA 92521Tel: 951 827-1012UCR LibraryCampus StatusCampus StoreCareer OpportunitiesDiversityMaps and DirectionsVisit UCRUniversity of California, Riverside             900 University Ave.            Riverside, CA 92521                          tel: 951 827-0000                        email: webmaster@ucr.edu  Find UsFollow US:Related LinksUCR News ArchiveScience TodayServicio de Informaci\u00f3n en Espa\u00f1olUC Agricultural and Natural Resources newsUC NewsroomAvailable FeedsCreator State PodcastPrivacy PolicyTerms and Conditions\u00a9 2021 Regents of the University of CaliforniaSearch\u00d7Let us help you with your searchEnter your Search Criteria.Search All UCRSearch This SiteCancel"}, {"id": 88, "url": "https://www.ece.ucr.edu/news/2021/05/06/alexander-balandin-named-dod-vannevar-bush-faculty-fellow/", "html": "Access BCOE COVID-19 information and guidance.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Submit a return-to-work proposal.\u00a0 \u00a0Request a one-time visit to BCOE.\u00a0 Take the daily wellness check survey.Skip to main contentA to Z ListingCampus MapFind PeopleNewsSkip to main contentMarlan and Rosemary Bourns College of EngineeringSearchBCOE Departments & ProgramsMARLAN AND ROSEMARY BOURNS COLLEGE OF ENGINEERINGBioengineeringChemical and Environmental EngineeringComputer EngineeringComputer Science and EngineeringData ScienceElectrical and Computer EngineeringMaterials Science and EngineeringMechanical EngineernigOnline M.S. in EngineeringUC Riverside Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering We Engineer ExcellenceSearchUndergraduateProspectiveApply OnlineCurrentAdvisingNew Student OrientationProgram Requirements    Focus AreasProgramsElectrical EngineeringComputer EngineeringMaterials Science and EngineeringCoursesStudent ProjectsABETFinancial InformationGraduateProgram OverviewAdmissionsOverviewDomestic ApplicantsInternational ApplicantsECE UCR DifferenceRequest InfoApplyFAQContinuingAcademicsOverviewBS+MSMSEECENPhDResourcesGraduate Student ManualNew Student InformationGraduate Student Association GSACoursesPeopleFacultyCooperating FacultyResearch FacultyLecturersAdjunct FacultyStaffResearchAreas of ResearchOverviewCommunications, Signal Processing, and NetworkingComputer EngineeringControl and RoboticsIntelligent SystemsNanotechnology, Advanced Materials, and DevicesPower Systems and Smart GridResearch LabsOverviewCommunications, Signal Processing, and NetworkingComputer EngineeringControl and RoboticsIntelligent SystemsNanotechnology, Advanced Materials, and DevicesPower Systems and Smart GridResearch CentersAboutMessage from the ChairMission StatementHistoryFacts and FiguresBoard of AdvisorsEngagementStudent Clubs and OrganizationsOutreachStem Summer CampEventsNewsResearch HighlightsGivingOverviewGiving OpportunitiesEmploymentBCOE Departments & ProgramsMARLAN AND ROSEMARY BOURNS COLLEGE OF ENGINEERINGBioengineeringChemical and Environmental EngineeringComputer EngineeringComputer Science and EngineeringData ScienceElectrical and Computer EngineeringMaterials Science and EngineeringMechanical EngineernigOnline M.S. in EngineeringBreadcrumbLatest NewsMay 6th, 2021Alexander Balandin named DoD Vannevar Bush Faculty Fellow Alexander Balandin named DoD Vannevar Bush Faculty FellowMay 06, 2021 ECE Distinguished Professor Alexander Balandin has been awarded a 2021 Department of Defense DoD Vannevar Bush Faculty Fellowship\u00a0.

25th, 2021Konstantinos Karydis receives NSF CAREER Award on Resilient Dynamic Locomotion of Compliant/Soft Legged Robots for Precision Agriculture Konstantinos Karydis receives NSF CAREER Award on Resilient Dynamic Locomotion of Compliant/Soft Legged Robots for Precision AgricultureFebruary 25, 2021 Assistant Professor Konstantinos Karydis\u00a0receives National Science Foundation NSF CAREER award for a project titled \"CAREER: Morphological Computation for Resilient Dynamic Locomotion of Compliant Legged Robots with Application to Precision Agriculture\"The project investigates how compliance embedded into a legged robot can be harnessed to facilitate control and computation, with an eye to enabling efficient and resilient navigation in real agricultural fields.\u00a0 Research activities innovate along three key foundational robotics research directions.\u00a0 1 Hardware design and dynamic modeling: The project offers fundamental insights and develops models regarding the effect of various forms of compliance on center of mass motion and gait stabilization for certain classes of legged robots and introduces new hardware designs that can harness compliance and enable principles of morphological computation.\u00a0 2 Locomotion control: The project establishes compliance-aware legged locomotion controllers according to principles of whole-body and central pattern generator-based control to enable efficient closed-loop legged locomotion over a range of engineered and natural unstructured terrains.\u00a0 3 Non-holonomic motion planning and autonomous navigation: The project develops non-holonomic motion planners that rely upon and utilize distinctive features of robot body morphology and embedded compliance for efficiency and resilience during autonomous legged locomotion over real agricultural fields.\u00a0 This research can transform the science and technology of autonomous legged robots by making them more efficient and resilient in their operation, and thus unlock legged robots\u2019 full potential in precision agriculture.NSF web link: https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2046270&HistoricalAwards=falseResearch lab web

The foundations of materials science and engineering are the basic sciences of physics, chemistry, and mathematics. An engineer working with the great variety of materials responses at the electrical, optical, magnetic, mechanical, and chemical levels must have a solid scientific foundation and breadth of basic knowledge from the physical sciences and engineering.Many applications today require broad-based materials knowledge. A materials engineer may specialize in a specific class of materials magnetic materials, nanostructured materials, polymers, biological materials, etc. or a specific area of materials science electrical properties, mechanical properties, materials processing, materials testing, etc., but should possess a broad background in materials science and engineering. Increased emphasis on cost, weight, and size reduction, while still improving product performance, creates challenges for monolithic materials, and opportunities for composites, nanostructures and other new materials. Miniaturization of components frequently is limited by the interactions of dissimilar materials at a microscopic and nanometer scale. A materials engineer must be able to optimize the overall performance of complex systems involving several materials.\u00a0[back to top]Materials Science and Engineering at the University of California - RiversideIn 2007, the Bourns College of Engineering BCOE established a new program and started to offer a Bachelor of Science degree in Materials Science and Engineering. The MSE program at UCR aims to provide fundamental knowledge for understanding of materials with the objective of predicting, modifying, and tailoring the properties of materials to achieve enhanced performance of the materials and devices based on these materials. This degree program is administered by the Materials Science and Engineering MSE Committee in Charge, which consists of Professor Alexander A. Balandin Department of Electrical Engineering, Professor Cengiz Ozkan Department of Mechanical Engineering, Professor Nosang Myung Department of Chemical and Environmental Engineering, Professor Mart Molle Department of Computer Science and Engineering and Professor Valentine Vullev Department of Bioengineering. The committee is chaired by Professor Balandin.The Committee in Charge, which consists of the representatives of each department in the Bourns College of Engineering, has the responsibility for approval and management of the Materials Science and Engineering courses. The teaching faculty for this interdepartmental program is drawn from the College of Engineering. The courses included in the MSE major curriculum have either MSE subject abbreviation or the department subject abbreviation, e.g., ME, CEE, EE, etc. Each department of the College of Engineering offers a focus area within the MSE program through a set of technical electives TE, which emphasize a certain aspect of materials science and engineering.During the first two years the students take general education courses mathematics; physics; chemistry; breadth requirements and the lower-division courses offered by the participating departments. A dedicated MSE course offered during the freshman year MSE 1: Fundamentals of Materials Science and Engineering, introduces the students to the basics of the materials science and engineering. During the third year, the students take the materials core courses. The core courses are offered jointly by all departments.\u00a0[back to top]Bachelor of Science in Materials Science and Engineering degree major requirements\u00a0Suggested course planMaterials Science and Engineering as an Interdisciplinary FieldThe MSE program at the Bourns College of Engineering is truly interdisciplinary, cutting across departmental and collegiate lines. The faculty members from various departments and with different backgrounds participate in the program. BCOE has a substantial number of faculty members who carry out experimental, theoretical and computational research in materials science and engineering. The MSE program is synergetic with the campus interdisciplinary nanotechnology efforts and investments. The MSE program at UCR is very different from the existing materials programs in other UC campuses and nearby universities. It is the only undergraduate program that involves all departments of the College of Engineering. The program structure implemented at UCR emphasizes the interdisciplinary nature of the field and encourages interdepartmental cooperation.The students enrolled in the MSE program benefit from the unique research facilities existing and currently under development at UCR. These facilities include the materials synthesis and characterization resources available in the Department of Bioengineering, Department of Chemical and Environmental Engineering, Department of Electrical Engineering and the Department of Mechanical Engineering. The Center for Nanoscale Science and Engineering CNSE and the Central Facility for Advanced Microscopy and Microanalysis CFAMM offer additional instrumentation, which can be used in the student training. Modern materials science and engineering involves a substantial computational component, i.e., computational materials science. The MSE students benefit from the computational resources available in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Department of Electrical Engineering, and the campus-wide computational facilities.\u00a0\u00a0[back to top]SearchUniversity of California, Riverside900 University Ave.            Riverside, CA 92521Tel: 951 827-1012UCR LibraryCampus StatusCampus StoreCareer OpportunitiesDiversityMaps and DirectionsVisit UCRMaterials Science and Engineering Program             313 Materials Science & Engineering Building            900 University Ave.             Riverside, CA 92521              tel: 951 827-3383                        email: mse-program@engr.ucr.edu Follow US:Visit BCOEs Facebook page external site: FacebookFollow BCOE on Twitter external site: TwitterVisit BCOEs YouTube channel external site: YouTubeFollow UCR on Instagram external site: InstagramJoin the LinkedIn alumni group external site: LinkedInVisit BCOEs Flickr gallery external site: FlickrSubscribe to MSE news via RSSPrivacy PolicyTerms and Conditions\u00a9 2021 Regents of the University of California\u00d7Let us help you with your searchEnter your Search Criteria.Search All UCRSearch This SiteCancel"}, {"id": 100, "url": "http://financialaid.ucr.edu/", "html": "Our office is operating remotely and can now assist you by phone at 951-827-3878 from Monday to Friday, 9AM to 4PM.\u00a0 Or you can email us at\u00a0finaid@ucr.edu.

If approved by the Systemwide Coordinating Committee on Graduate Affairs and the University of California UC Office of the Provost, the new M.S. degree could accept its first cohort of students early as Fall 2021. The program would become the first Master\u2019s Robotics program within the UC system.\u00a0 \u00a0Robotics is a fast-growing field driven by recent advances in artificial intelligence research and technology development and presents a wealth of career opportunities in industries such as manufacturing, logistics, health care, public safety, government, and the military.At the National Science Foundation NSF, robotics is at the forefront of multiple initiatives, including NSF\u2019s 10 Big Ideas, Emerging Frontiers in Research and Innovation which is focused on soft robotics, and the National Robotics Initiative and Cyber-Physical Systems program. Robotics is also a critical part of many research programs at the U.S. Department of Defense, which plans to invest over $2 billion over the next five years in artificial intelligence research.Currently, BCOE offers coursework in relevant sub-areas of robotics: mechanical engineering offers courses in robot design and control, electrical engineering in control and machine learning, computer engineering in real-time system design, and computer science in machine learning and data mining.In response to the student demand of these popular BCOE courses, if approved, the M.S. Robotics curriculum will provide a more holistic understanding of robotics and culminate in an interdisciplinary training in the design, construction, and deployment of robots and autonomous systems. The program will be open to students with undergraduate degrees from the above-mentioned departments, and potentially to those with backgrounds in physics or mathematics. \u00a0The job growth outlook and salary opportunities for robotics are promising. In its report \"The Future of Jobs 2018,\" the World Economic Forum projects that artificial intelligence could create 58 million new jobs globally by 2022. Whats more, LinkedIn has\u00a0seen hiring for artificial\u00a0intelligence specialists increase\u00a0by 74 percent in the past four years, and hiring for robotics engineers increase by 40 percent.\u00a0By earning an advanced educational degree, BCOE engineering students can greatly increase their earning potential for the long-term. The National Research Council states that \u201csalaries of master\u2019s degree holders in science and engineering have grown faster over the past 10 years than salaries of baccalaureate or doctorate holders.\u201dMore updates and details of the program are expected to follow, pending additional approval by UC entities.Share ThisMore NewsSearchUniversity of California, Riverside900 University Ave.            Riverside, CA 92521Tel: 951 827-1012UCR LibraryCampus StatusCampus StoreCareer OpportunitiesDiversityMaps and DirectionsVisit UCRMarlan and Rosemary Bourns College of Engineering             446 Winston Chung Hall            900 University Ave.             Riverside, CA 92521              tel: 951 827-5190                 fax: 951 827-3188         email: news@engr.ucr.edu Related LinksBCOE Available Conference Rooms and Technology ResourcesGive to BournsIntranetFaculty ResourcesMarketing ResourcesSystemsFollow US:Visit BCOEs Facebook page external site: FacebookFollow BCOE on Twitter external site: TwitterVisit BCOEs YouTube channel external site: YouTubeVisit BCOEs Flickr gallery external site: FlickrSubscribe to BCOE News via RSS FeedPrivacy PolicyTerms and Conditions\u00a9 2021 Regents of the University of California\u00d7Let us help you with your searchEnter your Search Criteria.Search All UCRSearch This SiteCancel"}, {"id": 105, "url": "http://ece2bcoe.ucr.acsitefactory.com/domestic-applicants/", "html": "Access BCOE COVID-19 information and guidance.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Submit a return-to-work proposal.\u00a0 \u00a0Request a one-time visit to BCOE.\u00a0 Take the daily wellness check survey.Skip to main contentA to Z ListingCampus MapFind PeopleNewsSkip to main contentMarlan and Rosemary Bourns College of EngineeringSearchBCOE Departments & ProgramsMARLAN AND ROSEMARY BOURNS COLLEGE OF ENGINEERINGBioengineeringChemical and Environmental EngineeringComputer EngineeringComputer Science and EngineeringData ScienceElectrical and Computer EngineeringMaterials Science and EngineeringMechanical EngineernigOnline M.S. in EngineeringUC Riverside Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering We Engineer ExcellenceSearchUndergraduateProspectiveApply OnlineCurrentAdvisingNew Student OrientationProgram Requirements    Focus AreasProgramsElectrical EngineeringComputer EngineeringMaterials Science and EngineeringCoursesStudent ProjectsABETFinancial InformationGraduateProgram OverviewAdmissionsOverviewDomestic ApplicantsInternational ApplicantsECE UCR DifferenceRequest InfoApplyFAQContinuingAcademicsOverviewBS+MSMSEECENPhDResourcesGraduate Student ManualNew Student InformationGraduate Student Association GSACoursesPeopleFacultyCooperating FacultyResearch FacultyLecturersAdjunct FacultyStaffResearchAreas of ResearchOverviewCommunications, Signal Processing, and NetworkingComputer EngineeringControl and RoboticsIntelligent SystemsNanotechnology, Advanced Materials, and DevicesPower Systems and Smart GridResearch LabsOverviewCommunications, Signal Processing, and NetworkingComputer EngineeringControl and RoboticsIntelligent SystemsNanotechnology, Advanced Materials, and DevicesPower Systems and Smart GridResearch CentersAboutMessage from the ChairMission StatementHistoryFacts and FiguresBoard of AdvisorsEngagementStudent Clubs and OrganizationsOutreachStem Summer CampEventsNewsResearch HighlightsGivingOverviewGiving OpportunitiesEmploymentBCOE Departments & ProgramsMARLAN AND ROSEMARY BOURNS COLLEGE OF ENGINEERINGBioengineeringChemical and Environmental EngineeringComputer EngineeringComputer Science and EngineeringData ScienceElectrical and Computer EngineeringMaterials Science and EngineeringMechanical EngineernigOnline M.S. in EngineeringBreadcrumbDomestic Applicants U.S. CitizenDomestic Applicants U.S. CitizenFall 2021 Applicants: Its not too late!September 1st \u2013 Deadline to submit a complete application\u00a0for domestic applicantsApply HereA Bachelor of Science B.S. degree from an accredited institution or its equivalent in any areas of engineering or in the related areas of Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, Material Sciences and Computer Sciences.
