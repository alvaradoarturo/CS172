Last year was a consequential one, necessitating adaptation and growth in every aspect of society, including in the CEE department. Through it all, our students, faculty, staff and alumni have demonstrated their leadership, resilience and deep commitment to supporting the innovative education and cutting-edge research that are the hallmarks of our department.\u00a0Making the health and safety of our entire community our highest priority, our dedicated faculty worked hard to completely transform our curriculum for online instruction.

Some of our buildings are much older and have some limitations. Our buildings are designed to provide sufficientair changes based on building activities. We are making a special effort to ensure that all buildings have current filter changes. The information below is how HVAC systems are maintained.Expanded Timeframe: To help with airflow, Facilities Services is expanding the length of time outside airflow will circulate throughout each building.Filtration Maintenance: Building filtration systems are well maintained and have the appropriate level of filters for each building.Air Flow: To accommodate efficient airflow in each building, the most advanced level of filtersare being used based on the building\u2019s air filtration system capabilities.Building VentilationStrict adherence to the public health posters and other visual cues throughout campus and in buildings will reduce transmission risks. Ventilation systems will continue to operate as designed even thoughbuilding occupancy will be reduced. This will further reduce the risk of potential airborne transmission.\u00a0 While each individual occupant of a campus building will want to make sure these guidelines arefollowed, including limited occupancy, it will be very important to ensure that all the other occupants in that building, at least on that same floor, coordinate to ensure the overall density and guidelines arebeing followed on a collective basis.Transmission Reduction EffortsAccording to the World Health Organization WHO and the Centers for Disease Control CDC, the COVID-19 virus appears to spread human-to-human through respiratory droplets coming from an infected person. Based on public health guidance, the key transmission reduction factors include:social distancing,limiting occupancy,practicing good personal hygiene, andutilizing face coveringsAs part of the public health guidance, Facilities Services will disinfect high-touch areas including elevators, door handles, common areas and restrooms. We have made disinfecting kits available to departments and hand sanitizing stations are located at the entrance of each building. A map locating sanitizing stations can be viewed by clicking here.\u00a0HVAC ventilation FAQsResources and SOPsSignageThe campus has developed standard signage and postings for building entrances, exits, stairs, elevators and more.

The project will be led by bioengineering professor Xiaoping Hu and psychology professor Aaron Seitz. The location of the locus coeruleus in the brain. Wikimedia CommonsThe locus coeruleus is a region of the brain involved with physiological responses to stress and fear. It is the primary producer in the brain of norepinephrine, a hormone that activates the body\u2019s \u201cfight or flight\u201d response to frightening or stressful situations by increasing heart rate, releasing glucose into the bloodstream, and increasing blood flow to the muscles. \u00a0In the brain, norepinephrine acts as a neurotransmitter, passing messages between neurons to increase alertness and reaction time, and affect mood and ability to concentrate. There is substantial evidence that the locus coeruleus circuit plays a central role in cognitive processes. Neuronal loss in the locus coeruleus is known to occur in neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer\u2019s disease and related dementias and Parkinson\u2019s disease dementia.\u00a0Scientists think healthy locus coeruleus neurons preserve cognitive abilities during normal aging, but few studies have examined differences between individuals to establish a baseline. The locus coeruleus is small and difficult to image, so most research to date has used pupil dilation as a surrogate measure of locus coeruleus activity.Hu and Seitz, along with UC Riverside psychology colleagues Illana Bennett and Weiwei Zhang, and Megan Peters at UC Irvine, have pioneered advanced neuroimaging methods to image the locus coeruleus.\u00a0They will conduct detailed psychophysical and magnetic resonance imaging studies of older adults to understand how locus coeruleus structure and function regulates behavior and how this, in turn, is mediated by activity in other brain regions known to be involved in perception and memory. Their efforts will allow them to use computational approaches to define individual differences in the way locus coeruleus circuit integrity relates to different patterns of cognitive performance across tasks.The team hopes their work can help explain how dysfunctional modulatory circuits may generate cognitive declines or be implicated in normal aging and age-related disorders such as Alzheimer\u2019s and related disorders. The results have the potential to support noninvasive methods for diagnosing pathologies associated with locus coeruleus decline and developing new treatments.Header photo:\u00a0Artyom Kabajev\u00a0on\u00a0\u00a0UnsplashShare this ArticleMedia ContactsTagsBourns College Of EngineeringCollege Of Natural And Agricultural SciencesDepartment Of BioengineeringDepartment of PsychologyNeuroscienceAlzheimersXiaoping HuAaron SeitzScience / TechnologyRelated ArticlesScience / TechnologyUCR joins forces with NASA on missions to VenusScience / TechnologyA new water treatment technology could also help Mars explorersScience / TechnologyA new dimension in the quest to understand dark matter Science / Technology$3 million grant aims to prolong life for dialysis patientsSearchUniversity of California, Riverside900 University Ave.            Riverside, CA 92521Tel: 951 827-1012UCR LibraryCampus StatusCampus StoreCareer OpportunitiesDiversityMaps and DirectionsVisit UCRUniversity of California, Riverside             900 University Ave.            Riverside, CA 92521                          tel: 951 827-0000                        email: webmaster@ucr.edu  Find UsFollow US:Related LinksUCR News ArchiveScience TodayServicio de Informaci\u00f3n en Espa\u00f1olUC Agricultural and Natural Resources newsUC NewsroomAvailable FeedsCreator State PodcastPrivacy PolicyTerms and Conditions\u00a9 2021 Regents of the University of CaliforniaSearch\u00d7Let us help you with your searchEnter your Search Criteria.Search All UCRSearch This SiteCancel"}, {"id": 38, "url": "https://news.ucr.edu/articles/2021/06/03/new-water-treatment-technology-could-also-help-mars-explorers/", "html": "COVID-19\u00a0information, guidance, and resources.

As a powerful oxidizer, perchlorate is also manufactured and used in solid rocket fuel, fireworks, munitions, airbag initiators for vehicles, matches and signal flares. It is\u00a0a byproduct in some disinfectants and herbicides.\u00a0 Jinyong LiuBecause of its ubiquity in both soil and industrial goods, perchlorate is a common water contaminant that causes certain thyroid disorders. Perchlorate\u00a0bioaccumulates in plant tissues and a large amount of perchlorate found in Martian soil could make food grown there unsafe to eat, limiting the potential for human settlements on Mars. Perchlorate in Martian dust could also be hazardous to explorers. Current methods of removing perchlorate from water require either harsh conditions or a multistep enzymatic process to lower the oxidation state of the chlorine element into the harmless chloride ion.Doctoral student Changxu Ren and Jinyong Liu, an assistant professor of chemical and environmental engineering at UC Riverside\u2019s Marlan and Rosemary Bourns College of Engineering, took inspiration from nature to reduce perchlorate in water at ambient pressure and temperature in one simple step.Ren and Liu noted anaerobic microbes use molybdenum in their enzymes to reduce perchlorate and harvest energy in oxygen-starved environments.\u201cPrevious efforts in constructing a chemical molybdenum catalyst for perchlorate reduction have not been successful,\u201d Liu said. \u201cMany other metal catalysts either require harsh conditions or are not compatible with water.\u201d Changxu RenThe researchers tried to emulate the complicated microbial perchlorate reduction process with a simplified approach. They found by simply mixing a common fertilizer called sodium molybdate, a common organic ligand called bipyridine to bind the molybdenum, and a common hydrogen-activating catalyst called palladium on carbon, they produced a powerful catalyst that quickly and efficiently broke down the perchlorate in water using hydrogen gas at room temperature with no combustion involved.\u201cThis catalyst is much more active than any other chemical catalyst reported to date and reduces more than 99.99% of the perchlorate into chloride regardless of the initial perchlorate concentration,\u201d Ren said.The new catalyst reduces perchlorate in a wide concentration range, from less than 1 milligram per liter to 10 grams per liter. This makes it suitable for use in various scenarios, including remediating contaminated groundwater, treating heavily contaminated wastewater from explosives manufacturing, and making Mars habitable.\u201cA convenient catalytic reduction system may help harvest oxygen gas from perchlorate washed from the Martian soil when the catalyst is coupled with other processes,\u201d Liu said.The paper, \u201cA bioinspired molybdenum catalyst for aqueous perchlorate reduction,\u201d was published in the Journal of the American Chemical Society. Ren and Liu were joined in the research by UC Riverside doctoral student Jinyu Gao, undergraduate student Jacob Palmer, and high school student Eric Y. Bi. Peng Yang and Mengqiang Zhu at the University of Wyoming characterized the catalyst with X-ray absorption spectroscopies and Ohio State University\u2019s Jiaonan Sun and Yiying Wu performed the electrochemical testing.

Members of environmental justice communities experiencing racialized poverty, classified as essential workers and thus not able to shelter in place at home, and living in a region with some of the worst air quality in the country, have borne the brunt of it,\u201d said Jade Sasser, an associate professor of gender & sexuality studies and lead author. \u201cWe wanted to make an intervention by raising awareness of the inequities right here in our own communities.\u201d A map showing how Latino population density, poor air quality, and Covid-19 overlap in the Inland Empire. Sasser et. al., 2021Covid-19 has hit many Black and Latino communities especially hard, but few interventions target the overlapping forms of inequality that make these communities more vulnerable in the first place. The authors call for a regulatory infrastructure that maintains safety protocols in workplaces that disproportionately expose communities of color and the poor to highly transmissible diseases like Covid-19.\u00a0They also recommend environmental health scientists characterize the exposome in homes and workplaces of the most severely affected populations during the Covid-19 crisis, such as essential workers, and build databases of exposure data at the individual level that can be mined for predictive and mitigation purposes.\u00a0\u201cWe now have the technology and connectivity to build these databases, which helps mitigate real-time exposure for people who may not be aware of their day-to-day air pollution exposure risks,\u201d said Sunni Ivey, an assistant professor of chemical and environmental engineering whose work focuses on modeling air quality.One area in particular need of attention is the link between air quality and susceptibility to Covid-19. Using data from California OEHHA CalEnviroScreen database in the Inland Empire region of southern California, which consists of Riverside and San Bernardino Counties, the authors show that areas with especially large numbers of Covid-19 cases are also predominantly Latino and have very high environmental vulnerability scores caused by air pollution from trucks associated with the numerous warehouses in these neighborhoods, among other factors.\u00a0The Inland Empire has long had notoriously poor air quality because natural air currents bring gaseous pollutants and particulate matter from the Los Angeles area while the warehousing and logistics boom has potentially increased emissions from diesel trucks and trains. Inhaling traffic-related pollutants like diesel particulate matter makes people more susceptible to a range of respiratory health problems. The authors cite a recent study that showed that small increases in particulate matter translate to an 11% increase in the Covid-19 death rate.\u201cResearch shows that inhalation exposure to fine particles and other pollutants leads to increased inflammation in the lungs and the development of asthma. We need more information on the interaction between respiratory health and COVID-19 severity,\u201d said Ivey.Many of the people living in Inland Empire communities devastated by Covid-19 also work in these warehouses and other essential occupations. They face the double jeopardy of greater vulnerability due to poor air quality and of workplace exposure. Many also have low wages and inadequate healthcare. The authors call for research into interventions that acknowledge and address the intersectional nature of Covid-19 inequities.Sasser and Ivey were joined in the research by Bronwyn Leebaw, Brandon Brown, Chikako Takeshita, and Alexander Nguyen, all of whom are at UC Riverside. The open access commentary, \u201cIntersectional perspectives on COVID-19 exposure,\u201d is published in the Journal of Exposure Science & Environmental Epidemiology and available here.\u00a0Share this StoryTagsResearch Bloginland empireCOVID-19environmental justiceRelated StoriesHow UCR created a successful COVID-19 testing programAlgorithm helps speed up simulation of vast, complex universesStudy helps explain how shingles vaccination coverage differs among social groupsFAQ on UCs proposed COVID-19 vaccination policySearchUniversity of California, Riverside900 University Ave.            Riverside, CA 92521Tel: 951 827-1012UCR LibraryCampus StatusCampus StoreCareer OpportunitiesDiversityMaps and DirectionsVisit UCRUniversity of California, Riverside             900 University Ave.            Riverside, CA 92521                          tel: 951 827-0000                        email: webmaster@ucr.edu  Find UsFollow US:Related LinksUCR NewsResearch BlogInside UCR ArchiveHuman ResourcesUC Path PortalStaff AssemblyUC NewsroomPrivacy PolicyTerms and Conditions\u00a9 2021 Regents of the University of CaliforniaSearch\u00d7Let us help you with your searchEnter your Search Criteria.Search All UCRSearch This SiteCancel"}, {"id": 40, "url": "https://www.engr.ucr.edu/news/2021/05/26/79000-raised-professor-emeritus-tom-paynes-79th-birthday/", "html": "Access BCOE COVID-19 information and guidance.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Submit a return-to-work proposal.\u00a0 \u00a0Request a one-time visit to BCOE.\u00a0 Take the daily wellness check survey.Skip to main contentMarlan and Rosemary Bourns College of EngineeringBCOE Departments & ProgramsMARLAN AND ROSEMARY BOURNS COLLEGE OF ENGINEERINGBioengineeringChemical and Environmental EngineeringComputer EngineeringComputer Science and EngineeringData ScienceElectrical and Computer EngineeringMaterials Science and EngineeringMechanical EngineernigOnline M.S. in EngineeringSearchUC Riverside Marlan and Rosemary Bourns College of Engineering Celebrating 30 YearsSearchStudentsProspective UndergradWhy BCOE?Majors & Programs TransferScholarshipsMeet AlumniApply NowProspective GraduateApply NowVisit BCOECurrent StudentsBS + MS ProgramUCR Education Abroad OfficeUndergrad researchAdvisingTransfer centerCampus resourcesSchool calendarStudent NewslettersResearchResearch CapabilitiesResearch centersUndergraduate ResearchFacilitiesUser FacilitiesMSE User FacilitiesNanofabrication FacilityMachine Shop Central Facility for Advanced Microscopy and MicroanalysisParentsBCOE BoostersNew Parent FAQsPartnersIndustry PartnersME CO-OP ProgramDeans innovation fundCouncil of AdvisorsMake a giftAlumniAlumniMentorRecruitMake a giftAboutMessage from the deanCollege leadership Departments and ProgramsBioengineeringChemical & Environmental EngineeringComputer EngineeringComputer Science & EngineeringElectrical & Computer EngineeringMasters in Engineering OnlineMaterials Science & EngineeringMechanical EngineeringPeopleEmploymentNewsEventsContact usStudentsProspective UndergradWhy BCOE?Majors & Programs TransferScholarshipsMeet AlumniApply NowProspective GraduateApply NowVisit BCOECurrent StudentsBS + MS ProgramUCR Education Abroad OfficeUndergrad researchAdvisingTransfer centerCampus resourcesSchool calendarStudent NewslettersResearchResearch CapabilitiesResearch centersUndergraduate ResearchFacilitiesUser FacilitiesMSE User FacilitiesNanofabrication FacilityMachine Shop Central Facility for Advanced Microscopy and MicroanalysisParentsBCOE BoostersNew Parent FAQsPartnersIndustry PartnersME CO-OP ProgramDeans innovation fundCouncil of AdvisorsMake a giftAlumniAlumniMentorRecruitMake a giftAboutMessage from the deanCollege leadership BioengineeringChemical & Environmental EngineeringComputer EngineeringComputer Science & EngineeringElectrical & Computer EngineeringMasters in Engineering OnlineMaterials Science & EngineeringMechanical EngineeringPeopleEmploymentNewsEventsContact usBCOE Departments & ProgramsMARLAN AND ROSEMARY BOURNS COLLEGE OF ENGINEERINGBioengineeringChemical and Environmental EngineeringComputer EngineeringComputer Science and EngineeringData ScienceElectrical and Computer EngineeringMaterials Science and EngineeringMechanical EngineernigOnline M.S. in EngineeringBreadcrumbLatest NewsMay 26th, 2021$79,000 raised for Professor Emeritus Tom Payne\u2019s 79th birthday $79,000 raised for Professor Emeritus Tom Payne\u2019s 79th birthdayMay 26, 2021 In April 2013, the Thomas H. Payne Scholarship in Computer Science was established with gifts from Professor Paynes former students, colleagues, friends and family. Nearly a decade later in 2021, and just in time for Professor Payne\u2019s 79th birthday, the fund has grown to $79,079. The fund was established to support undergraduate students in computer science.\u201cIt was both humbling and exciting when I learned we had reached the $79,000 goal for the scholarship,\u201d said Professor Payne. \u201cHumbling because it is an honor to be remembered by my former students, colleagues, and friends, and exciting to see how willing they are to help the next generation of students in computer science.\u201dThomas H. Payne received a Ph.D. in Mathematics from the University of Notre Dame in 1967. As a young man, Payne began a career at UC Riverside that would span over five decades. In his time at UCR, he frequently taught the CS10, 11, 12 entry series and upper-division course on compilers CS152 and on operating systems CS153. His research focused on areas of computing and formal logic, including computability theory and set theory.\u00a0 Professor Thomas PaynePayne saw the creation of the Bourns College of Engineering in the early 1990s, served as department chair from 1994 to 1999 and again from 2002 to 2007, during which time he was instrumental in the growth of the Computer Science and Engineering department. Since then, the department has become the largest engineering department at the college and is top\u2014ranked by CSRankings in multiple categories: 6th in High Performance Computing, 7th in Design Automation, 12th in Computational Bio and Bioinformatics, and 15th in Systems category overall.\u00a0Payne is well-known for being a trusted faculty member, mentor and friend to countless students and colleagues. He was more than a professor to thousands of students; he influenced and inspired them beyond the classroom. As former students said in a special video dedicated to Payne:\u201cYou are one of those professors; I can still remember not only all your terrific lectures, but also our discussions outside the classroom,\u201d said Brian Hawley, 1990 B.S. and 1991 M.S. in Computer Science.\u201cThank you for being the leader, the voice, and the storyteller, the person that helps explain why things are the way they are,\u201d said Titus Winters, 2004 M.S. and 2006 Ph.D. in Computer Science.With the creation of the scholarship, Payne continues to inspire BCOE\u2019s computer science students.\u201cIt\u2019s more than just the scholarship, it\u2019s more of a recognition,\u201d said Lucca Psaila, a fourth-year computer science undergraduate student and recipient of the Thomas Payne scholarship. \u201cYou have shown students like me that we\u2019re appreciated and acknowledged for the things that we do and the accomplishments we make. It allows me to continue on knowing that people are paying attention.\u201dIn a thank you message to the scholarship committee, Psaila continued that receiving the scholarship has inspired him to pay it forward after graduating, saying, \u201cI know one of the first things I\u2019m going to do: give back to my school and help other students who are in my previous situation.\u201dIf you\u2019d like to contribute to the Thomas Payne Scholarship in Computer Science, visit: https://crowdfunding.ucr.edu/o/university-of-california-riverside/i/ucrcrowdfunding/s/happy-birthday-thpShare ThisMore NewsSearchUniversity of California, Riverside900 University Ave.            Riverside, CA 92521Tel: 951 827-1012UCR LibraryCampus StatusCampus StoreCareer OpportunitiesDiversityMaps and DirectionsVisit UCRMarlan and Rosemary Bourns College of Engineering             446 Winston Chung Hall            900 University Ave.             Riverside, CA 92521              tel: 951 827-5190                 fax: 951 827-3188         email: news@engr.ucr.edu Related LinksBCOE Available Conference Rooms and Technology ResourcesGive to BournsIntranetFaculty ResourcesMarketing ResourcesSystemsFollow US:Visit BCOEs Facebook page external site: FacebookFollow BCOE on Twitter external site: TwitterVisit BCOEs YouTube channel external site: YouTubeVisit BCOEs Flickr gallery external site: FlickrSubscribe to BCOE News via RSS FeedPrivacy PolicyTerms and Conditions\u00a9 2021 Regents of the University of California\u00d7Let us help you with your searchEnter your Search Criteria.Search All UCRSearch This SiteCancel"}, {"id": 41, "url": "https://news.ucr.edu/articles/2021/05/25/uc-riverside-offers-uc-systems-first-masters-degree-robotics/", "html": "COVID-19\u00a0information, guidance, and resources.

Applications for fall 2021 admission are due by July 15 for international students, and by Sept. 1 for domestic students.The master\u2019s in Robotics provides interdisciplinary training in the design, construction, and deployment of robots and autonomous systems. Students will learn the foundational principles underlying mechanical and electronic aspects of robot design, control and navigation of robots, and artificial intelligence required for robots to perceive their surroundings and make decisions.\u201cThis exciting new program will help meet the growing need in the global workforce for robotics engineers and afford students both the breadth and depth of knowledge to excel in these lucrative science careers,\u201d said Amit Roy Chowdhury, professor of electrical and computer engineering and chair of the robotics degree program starting July 1, 2021. \u201cBy learning the latest theories from leading faculty experts in their field, students will be well prepared to address tomorrow\u2019s engineering challenges in artificial intelligence, computing, and more.\u201d \u00a0\u00a0The program brings under one umbrella popular courses in robotics currently offered in different departments. For example, Mechanical Engineering offers courses in robot design and control, Electrical and Computer Engineering, in control and machine learning, Computer Engineering, in real-time system design, and Computer Science and Engineering, in machine learning and data mining. The new degree allows students access to a curriculum that will provide a holistic understanding of robotics and deeper understanding of specialized aspects that correspond to their interests.Robotics deals with the design and operation of robots, which includes mechanical, electronic and computer design, as well as software systems that are capable of processing sensory inputs, reasoning about the operational environment, and making decisions about future operations. Advances in artificial intelligence research and technology development have driven rapid interest in robotics. Application areas include manufacturing, logistics, health care, public safety, and the military.One area of particular focus for the program will be algorithmic bias in artificial intelligence, or AI, and machine learning. The design of AI systems has been primarily the domain of white, male engineers, and UC Riverside will make an effort to recruit more diverse and inclusive robotics students. The program will also work closely with the computer science and electrical and computer engineering departments to address algorithmic bias, including how biased versus unbiased robots may harm society as the technology evolves.Students will be encouraged to participate with ongoing efforts at UCR to provide mentorship and broaden participation in robotics-related activities, such as UCR\u2019s K-12 Lego Robotics Competition. The robotics program will work with BCOE student organizations to create new opportunities for graduate student leadership and participation surrounding community outreach events.The program is jointly managed by the computer science and engineering, electrical and computer engineering, and mechanical engineering departments.To apply for the robotics program, visit https://robotics.engr.ucr.edu.\u00a0Share this ArticleMedia ContactsTagsBourns College Of EngineeringroboticsDepartment Of Electrical And Computer EngineeringDepartment of Mechanical EngineeringDepartment Of Computer Science And EngineeringScience / TechnologyRelated ArticlesScience / TechnologyStudy of perception and memory in older adults will improve understanding of dementiasScience / TechnologyUCR joins forces with NASA on missions to VenusScience / TechnologyA new water treatment technology could also help Mars explorersScience / TechnologyA new dimension in the quest to understand dark matter SearchUniversity of California, Riverside900 University Ave.            Riverside, CA 92521Tel: 951 827-1012UCR LibraryCampus StatusCampus StoreCareer OpportunitiesDiversityMaps and DirectionsVisit UCRUniversity of California, Riverside             900 University Ave.            Riverside, CA 92521                          tel: 951 827-0000                        email: webmaster@ucr.edu  Find UsFollow US:Related LinksUCR News ArchiveScience TodayServicio de Informaci\u00f3n en Espa\u00f1olUC Agricultural and Natural Resources newsUC NewsroomAvailable FeedsCreator State PodcastPrivacy PolicyTerms and Conditions\u00a9 2021 Regents of the University of CaliforniaSearch\u00d7Let us help you with your searchEnter your Search Criteria.Search All UCRSearch This SiteCancel"}, {"id": 42, "url": "https://news.ucr.edu/articles/2021/05/24/tiny-tomatoes-could-mean-big-profits-urban-agriculture/", "html": "COVID-19\u00a0information, guidance, and resources.

Tiny tomatoes suitable for vertical farming developed using CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing  technology at UC Riverside. Robert Jinkerson/UCRJinkerson has received a $450,000 New Innovator grant from the Foundation for Food & Agriculture Research, or FFAR, to advance this research. FFAR\u2019s New Innovator in Food & Agriculture Research Award provides early career scientists with funding to conduct audacious food and agriculture research.\u00a0By 2050, there will be nine billion people on the planet, but arable land is decreasing. Global food production will need to double to meet food needs, though climate change complicates the problem more.\u00a0\u201cUrban controlled environment agriculture can offer many benefits for the production of crops and is likely to supply more food in the future as worldwide food demand increases,\u201d Jinkerson said.Often these urban CEA systems are designed to have plant growth areas stacked vertically to save space. However, this also decreases the height available for plant growth, limiting the size of crops that can be cultivated in vertical farms to small leafy greens.\u201cIn order to overcome these size limitations and to increase the variety of crops that can be grown in vertical farms, we are engineering tomato plants to have a small stature and are optimized for this unique growing environment,\u201d said Jinkerson, who uses CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing to modulate key genes involved in plant development and architecture.\u00a0In addition to reducing the size of plants, this project will also increase the nutritional value of these crops by increasing their vitamin content, making urban agriculture more profitable.The potential applications for these tiny tomatoes don\u2019t end on Earth.Jinkerson, along with Martha Orozco-C\u00e1rdenas, director of the UCR Plant Transformation Research Center, have been awarded a NASA Space Biology grant to evaluate tomatoes from their prior work on the International Space Station. These plants, also engineered with gene editing technology and dubbed Small Plants for Agriculture in Controlled Environments, or SPACE tomatoes, will be grown in the Advanced Plant Habitat onboard the ISS to determine how these plants grow in microgravity. The SPACE tomatoes will be grown \u2018seed-to-seed,\u2019 meaning seeds will be harvested and the next generation grown in space, completing an entire lifecycle. These experiments, which will happen after several years of trials on Earth, will help establish methodologies to grow food on long duration space missions.\u201cWe are extremely excited to receive support for these projects and hope that the results will help transform the way we produce food here on Earth and beyond,\u201d said Jinkerson.Share this ArticleMedia ContactsTagsBourns College Of EngineeringDepartment Of Chemical And Environmental EngineeringRobert JinkersonfoodtomatoesScience / TechnologyRelated ArticlesScience / TechnologyStudy of perception and memory in older adults will improve understanding of dementiasScience / TechnologyUCR joins forces with NASA on missions to VenusScience / TechnologyA new water treatment technology could also help Mars explorersScience / TechnologyA new dimension in the quest to understand dark matter SearchUniversity of California, Riverside900 University Ave.            Riverside, CA 92521Tel: 951 827-1012UCR LibraryCampus StatusCampus StoreCareer OpportunitiesDiversityMaps and DirectionsVisit UCRUniversity of California, Riverside             900 University Ave.            Riverside, CA 92521                          tel: 951 827-0000                        email: webmaster@ucr.edu  Find UsFollow US:Related LinksUCR News ArchiveScience TodayServicio de Informaci\u00f3n en Espa\u00f1olUC Agricultural and Natural Resources newsUC NewsroomAvailable FeedsCreator State PodcastPrivacy PolicyTerms and Conditions\u00a9 2021 Regents of the University of CaliforniaSearch\u00d7Let us help you with your searchEnter your Search Criteria.Search All UCRSearch This SiteCancel"}, {"id": 43, "url": "https://news.ucr.edu/articles/2021/05/21/implantable-piezoelectric-polymer-improves-controlled-release-drugs/", "html": "COVID-19\u00a0information, guidance, and resources.

An implantable piezoelectric polymer nanofiber device that releases controlled amounts of a drug under mechanical force. Jin Nam/UCRThe drawbacks of conventional drug administration include repeated administration, nonspecific biodistribution in the body\u2019s systems, the long-term unsustainability of drug molecules, and high cytotoxicity, posing a challenge for the efficient treatment of chronic diseases that require varying drug dosages over time for optimal therapeutic efficacy. Most controlled release methods encapsulate drug particles in biodegradable, bubble-like containers that dissolve over time to release the drug, making it difficult to deliver drugs on a schedule. Others involve a battery-powered device that is not biocompatible.Jin Nam, an associate professor of bioengineering in UC Riverside\u2019s Marlan and Rosemary Bourns College of Engineering, runs a lab that works with biocompatible polymers to build frameworks known as scaffolds that help stem cells repair tissues and organs. One of these polymers, polyvinylidene fluoride-trifluro-ethylene, or PVDF-TrFE, can produce an electrical charge under mechanical stress. Nam realized this property, known as piezoelectricity, made the polymer a potentially viable candidate for a drug release system.His team used a technique called electrospinning to produce PVDF-TrFE nanofibers layered in a thin mat. Structuring the material in nanoscale by electrospinning optimized the sensitivity of the resulting nanofibers so the drug delivery system would respond to physiologically safe magnitudes of force while remaining insensitive to daily activities. The large surface area of the nanofibers allowed them to adsorb a relatively large quantity of drug molecules.\u00a0After embedding the film in a hydrogel that mimics living tissue, a series of tests using therapeutic shockwaves generated enough electric charge to release an electrostatically attached model drug molecule into the surrounding gel. The researchers could tune the drug release quantity by varying the applied pressure and duration.\u201cThis piezoelectric nanofiber-based drug delivery system enables localized delivery of drug molecules on demand, which would be useful for diseases or conditions that require long-term, repeated drug administration, such as cancer treatments,\u201d Nam said. \u201cThe large surface area-to-volume ratio of nanofibrous structure enables a greater drug loading, leading to a single injection or implantation that lasts longer than conventional drug delivery.\u201dCompared to traditional drug delivery systems based on degradation or diffusion release that typically show an initial burst release followed by different rates of release, the linear profile of drug release from the piezoelectric-based system allows for the precise administration of drug molecules regardless of implantation duration. Repeated on-demand drug release tests showed a similar amount of drug release per activation, confirming the robust control of release rate.\u00a0The sensitivity of the drug release kinetics can be tuned by controlling the nanofiber size to a range that is activated by therapeutic shockwaves, often used for musculoskeletal pain treatment with a handheld device. Smaller, more sensitive nanofiber sizes can be utilized for implantation in deep tissues, such as near a bone under muscles, while less sensitive larger nanofibers could find use in subcutaneous applications to avoid false activation by accidental impact.\u00a0Nam was joined in the research by Tanvi Jariwala, Gerardo Ico, Youyi Tai, Honghyun Park, and Nosang V. Myung. The paper, \u201cMechano-responsive piezoelectric nanofiber as an on-demand drug delivery vehicle,\u201d is available here.\u00a0Header photo: Chemotherapy drugs and an IV bottle.

18th, 2021UCR computer scientist earns NSF CAREER award to combat online misinformation and unlock the mystery of black holes  UCR computer scientist earns NSF CAREER award to combat online misinformation and unlock the mystery of black holes May 18, 2021 Assistant professor of computer science Evangelos Papalexakis at the Marlan and Rosemary Bourns College of Engineering BCOE has been awarded the prestigious National Science Foundation NSF CAREER Award on autonomous tensor analysis towards actionable insights from raw multi-aspect data, with applications for detecting misinformation online and detecting gravitational waves.\u201cI am very grateful for the generous support of NSF, which will allow my research group to focus and work on those ideas long-term,\u201d said Papalexakis. \u201cI am also extremely grateful for all the work done by my students and collaborators which laid the foundations for the proposed work and made all of this possible.\u201d\u00a0 Evangelos PapalexakisPapalexakis\u2019 research is largely focused on tensor decompositions for machine learning and data science. When applied to the real-world, it can improve computers\u2019 detection of what content is accurate versus what we would call \u201cfake news.\u201dWhen algorithms assess whether or not an article is trustworthy, they analyze multiple data points such as the text, images, author, publication date, and number of times it has been shared on social media.This type of analysis, called current tensor analysis, can be effective and powerful. Unfortunately, this approach is labor-intensive: requiring lots of trial-and-error tuning, familiarity with tensor methods, and domain expertise in the target application. Because of these barriers, practitioners do not widely use this method.The solution, as Papalexakis sees it, and the goal of this five-year NSF-funded award, is to democratize unsupervised exploratory tensor analysis \u2013 making it more accessible while producing actionable insights from the data. While other projects in meta-learning have been focused on automating supervised models, Papalexakis\u2019 project has the potential to create a new field of unsupervised exploratory meta-learning. This is the first task of the project.The second task will focus on real-world collaboration with domain experts in two distinct yet related scientific areas: in the web and in the cosmos. While the project will provide earth-bound tools to better judge the trustworthiness of news online, it also has out-of-this world implications. New findings could help scientists understand cosmic objects that do not emit light, commonly known as black holes, helping us unravel current mysteries of the universe.Papalexakis plans to integrate this research into undergraduate and graduate Data Science curricula, which is a newly offered undergraduate major at UCR, mentor undergraduate students from underrepresented groups, and organize summer workshops for local school districts to broaden Data Science in high school education.NSF CAREER Awards are awarded to assistant professors\u00a0to fund research that is expected to form a firm foundation for a lifetime of leadership in integrating education and research.Share ThisMore NewsSearchUniversity of California, Riverside900 University Ave.            Riverside, CA 92521Tel: 951 827-1012UCR LibraryCampus StatusCampus StoreCareer OpportunitiesDiversityMaps and DirectionsVisit UCRMarlan and Rosemary Bourns College of Engineering             446 Winston Chung Hall            900 University Ave.             Riverside, CA 92521              tel: 951 827-5190                 fax: 951 827-3188         email: news@engr.ucr.edu Related LinksBCOE Available Conference Rooms and Technology ResourcesGive to BournsIntranetFaculty ResourcesMarketing ResourcesSystemsFollow US:Visit BCOEs Facebook page external site: FacebookFollow BCOE on Twitter external site: TwitterVisit BCOEs YouTube channel external site: YouTubeVisit BCOEs Flickr gallery external site: FlickrSubscribe to BCOE News via RSS FeedPrivacy PolicyTerms and Conditions\u00a9 2021 Regents of the University of California\u00d7Let us help you with your searchEnter your Search Criteria.Search All UCRSearch This SiteCancel"}, {"id": 46, "url": "https://news.ucr.edu/articles/2021/05/17/nanofiber-filter-captures-almost-100-coronavirus-aerosols/", "html": "COVID-19\u00a0information, guidance, and resources.

The cotton mask and neck gaiter only removed about 45%-73% of the aerosols. The surgical mask did much better, removing 98% of coronavirus aerosols. But the nanofiber filter removed almost all of the coronavirus aerosols.\u00a0 Left: A nanofiber filter that captures 99.9% of coronavirus aerosols; Right: A highly magnified image of the polymer nanofibers. Photo: Yun ShenThe World Health Organization and Centers for Disease Control have both recognized aerosols as a major mechanism of COVID-19 virus transmission. Aerosols are tiny particles of water or other matter that can remain suspended in air for long periods of time and are small enough to penetrate the respiratory system.\u00a0People release aerosols whenever they breathe, cough, talk, shout, or sing. If they are infected with COVID-19, these aerosols can also contain the virus. Inhaling a sufficient quantity of coronavirus-laden aerosols can make people sick. Efforts to curb aerosol spread of COVID-19 focus on minimizing individual exposure and reducing the overall quantity of aerosols in an environment by asking people to wear masks and by improving indoor ventilation and air filtration systems.\u00a0Studying a contagious new virus is dangerous and done in labs with the highest biosecurity ratings, which are relatively rare. To date, all studies during the pandemic on mask or filter efficiency have used other materials thought to mimic the size and behavior of coronavirus aerosols. The new study improved on this by testing both aerosolized saline solution and an aerosol that contained a coronavirus in the same family as the virus that causes COVID-19, but only infects mice.\u00a0Shen and George Washington University colleague Danmeng Shuai produced a nanofiber filter by sending a high electrical voltage through a drop of liquid polyvinylidene fluoride to spin threads about 300 nanometers in diameter \u2014 about 167 times thinner than a human hair. The process created pores only a couple of micrometers in diameter on the nanofiber\u2019s surfaces, which helped them capture 99.9% of coronavirus aerosols.\u00a0The production technique, known as electrospinning, is cost effective and could be used to mass produce nanofiber filters for personal protective equipment and air filtration systems. Electrospinning also leaves the nanofibers with an electrostatic charge that enhances their ability to capture aerosols, and their high porosity makes it easier to breathe wearing electrospun nanofiber filters.\u201cElectrospinning can advance the design and fabrication of face masks and air filters,\u201d said Shen. \u201cDeveloping new masks and air filters by electrospinning is promising because of its high performance in filtration, economic feasibility, and scalability, and it can meet on-site needs of the masks and air filters.\u201dThe paper, \u201cDevelopment of electrospun nanofibrous filters for controlling coronavirus aerosols,\u201d is published in Environmental Science & Technology Letters.

UC Riverside engineers are solving this problem by vaporizing metals within a magnetic field to direct the reassembly of metal atoms into predictable shapes. The research is published in The Journal of Physical Chemistry Letters. Image showing the stringlike particles formed by iron and nickel and the more globular clusters formed by copper. Abbaschian, Zachariah, et. al. 2021Nanomaterials, which are made of particles measuring 1-100 nanometers, are typically created within a liquid matrix, which is expensive for bulk production applications, and in many cases cannot make pure metals, such as aluminum or magnesium. More economical production techniquess typically involve vapor phase approaches to create a cloud of particles condensing from the vapor. These suffer from a lack of control. \u00a0Reza Abbaschian, a distinguished professor of mechanical engineering; and Michael Zachariah, a distinguished professor of chemical and environmental engineering at UC Riverside\u2019s Marlan and Rosemary Bourns College of Engineering; joined forces to create nanomaterials from iron, copper, and nickel in a gas phase. They placed solid metal within a powerful electromagnetic levitation coil to heat the metal beyond its melting point, vaporizing it. The metal droplets levitated in the gas within the coil and moved in directions determined by their inherent reactions to magnetic forces. When the droplets bonded, they did so in an orderly fashion that the researchers learned they could predict based on the type of metal and how and where they applied the magnetic fields.Iron and nickel nanoparticles formed string-like aggregates while copper nanoparticles formed globular clusters. When deposited on a carbon film, iron and nickel aggregates gave the film a porous surface, while carbon aggregates gave it a more compact, solid surface. The qualities of the materials on the carbon film mirrored at larger scale the properties of each type of nanoparticle.Because the field can be thought of as an \u201cadd-on,\u201d this approach could be applied to any vapor-phase nanoparticle generation source where the structure is important, such as fillers used in polymer composites for magnetic shielding, or to improve electrical or mechanical properties.\u201cThis \u2018field directed\u2019 approach enables one to manipulate the assembly process and change the architecture of the resulting particles from high fractal dimension objects to lower dimension string-like structures. The field strength can be used to manipulate the extent of this arrangement,\u201d Zachariah said.\u00a0Abbaschian and Zachariah were joined in the research by Pankaj Ghildiyal, Prithwish Biswas, Steven Herrera, George W. Mulholland, and Yong Yang. The paper, \u201cMagnetic-field directed vapor-phase assembly of low fractal dimension metal nanostructures: experiment and theory,\u201d is available here.Share this ArticleMedia ContactsTagsBourns College Of EngineeringDepartment of Mechanical EngineeringDepartment Of Chemical And Environmental EngineeringReza AbbaschianMichael ZachariahNanomaterialsScience / TechnologyRelated ArticlesScience / TechnologyStudy of perception and memory in older adults will improve understanding of dementiasScience / TechnologyA new water treatment technology could also help Mars explorersScience / TechnologyUCR joins forces with NASA on missions to VenusScience / TechnologyA new dimension in the quest to understand dark matter SearchUniversity of California, Riverside900 University Ave.            Riverside, CA 92521Tel: 951 827-1012UCR LibraryCampus StatusCampus StoreCareer OpportunitiesDiversityMaps and DirectionsVisit UCRUniversity of California, Riverside             900 University Ave.            Riverside, CA 92521                          tel: 951 827-0000                        email: webmaster@ucr.edu  Find UsFollow US:Related LinksUCR News ArchiveScience TodayServicio de Informaci\u00f3n en Espa\u00f1olUC Agricultural and Natural Resources newsUC NewsroomAvailable FeedsCreator State PodcastPrivacy PolicyTerms and Conditions\u00a9 2021 Regents of the University of CaliforniaSearch\u00d7Let us help you with your searchEnter your Search Criteria.Search All UCRSearch This SiteCancel"}, {"id": 49, "url": "https://news.ucr.edu/custom/bourns-college-engineering/", "html": "COVID-19\u00a0information, guidance, and resources.

The violence that has recently taken the lives of George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor, Nina Pop, and countless others, are just the latest examples of unacceptable attacks on our Black citizens. We all have the same rights under law, but not in practice.\u00a0This must change now.Each of these deaths is tragic. Combined, they display a disturbing pattern of violence that stems from institutionalized racism in many of our workplaces, communities, and even our educational systems. These deaths, and the many that came before them, are abhorrent and the institutional protections of those committing these crimes must be removed and the criminals prosecuted. Calling out institutional racism is not enough.\u00a0Every institution must reevaluate its own culture and identify ways to make positive change.UC Riverside and BCOE have suffered from racial and gender bias. Over the past few weeks, Black students have shared racist experiences both on and off campus and Black faculty and staff have shared their pain in light of recent protests. Years of work groups, task forces, and diversity initiatives have repeatedly identified the same problems, and each has fallen short, resulting in a new committee identifying the same problems every few years. As an institution that creates future leaders, we need to do more to support Black members of our community in this moment of national crisis and moving forward. It is on every one of us not to tolerate racism on any level and to contribute to a culture and environment that welcomes and supports all students, staff, and faculty equally.We acknowledge that everyone within our BCOE community has been significantly impacted by the recent events. Understandably, our students have found it difficult to focus on coursework when a historic movement so many years in the making has been, in some cases, taking place right outside their homes and in their neighborhoods. We recognize and fully support our students who are lending their voices for change.\u00a0We implore every member of the BCOE community to commit to zero tolerance of racism of any kind. We call on the BCOE community to commit to the following actions as the first steps to ensuring BCOE is a safe, inclusive, and equitable community for our Black engineers:Speak up and speak out. As a community, we cannot tolerate racist rhetoric, institutional bias, or acts of violence. This is not a political statement.\u00a0This is human decency.Reevaluate recruitment, retention, and graduation rates annually and ensure our Black BCOE students have equitable access and support in their engineering education. We commit to working with our Black students to identify areas in need of improvement within our college as well as collecting recommendations from our students, faculty, staff, and local community to ensure a supportive community.Set the standard of acceptance. Our students have asked for training for all BCOE community members, including at new student orientations, new faculty orientations, and staff onboarding procedures to train employees and peers on working with Black audiences. BCOE commits to providing this training to set the standard for appropriate and inclusive behavior by both employees and student peers.Evaluate our K-12 outreach effort to enhance Black student opportunities. BCOE has been making efforts to increase the numbers of young Black scholars pursuing careers in engineering with insufficient success. We know we need to do better.\u00a0 By continually reviewing our outreach strategy, BCOE will work to ensure Black communities are engaged and will continue working in partnership with student organization leaders to develop meaningful programs.Continue working to establish partnerships with Historically Black Colleges and Universities HBCUs. When it comes to Black student enrollment at BCOE, we fall short. Building partnerships with HBCUs will strengthen the overall student experience and recruitment from these institutions will increase graduate enrollment of Black students in engineering at BCOE.Continue working to hire more Black faculty and staff. As the college continues to grow, we must do more to recruit and retain Black faculty and staff and remove the systemic barriers that breed bias, racism, and prejudice in the hiring process. Black students have recommended the hiring of Black faculty, advisors, and counselors to create a community where they are heard, understood, and supported.Create an open dialogue. On June 3, we held the first of what will be quarterly student organization leader calls with college administration to discuss challenges our student groups are facing. Feedback from these conversations will allow us to modify, pause, or strengthen programs and to grow the inclusiveness of our college culture. Enhance the Equity Advisor role. We must take this time to both redefine and expand upon the role of the college\u2019s equity advisor. In addition to developing a more purposeful mission for this role that helps support the Black engineering community, the college\u2019s equity advisor must be empowered to ensure the successful delivery of these initiatives.\u00a0\u00a0Develop scholarship pathways dedicated toward supporting Black engineers. In the coming months, we expect to complete our fundraising goal for UCR\u2019s first-ever student organization endowed fund. The NSBE Endowment Fund was launched earlier this year and was established in partnership with the Council for the Advancement of Black Engineers CABE and the National Society of Black Engineers NSBE. We are more than half-way to the $25,000 fundraising goal for an endowment that will support our NSBE students. Once we have reached our goal, we will expand upon this effort to create additional scholarship opportunities.Eliminating institutionalized racism is a complex challenge. One that requires transformative approaches to enact a change that is long overdue. We call on the BCOE community to recommit to ensuring we have an inclusive environment by holding each other accountable.Our students, staff, and faculty have endured immense hardship through this quarter \u2013 the isolation of quarantine, feeling worried about the health of family and friends, the stress of curfews, and now the level of effort needed to bring about real, long-term societal change.\u00a0This has been especially challenging for our students who are seeking a degree in one of the most challenging fields of study. It is on us as staff and faculty to support our students who will go on to define our future not just technologically but socially. UCR and BCOE students, we hear you. You have our support. We will emerge from this a stronger community and work together to achieve real change.\u00a0On behalf of the Marlan and Rosemary Bourns College of Engineering,Christopher S.

The Vannevar Bush Faculty Fellowship will help Balandin\u2019s group create a new comprehensive research field of one-dimensional quantum materials. The project\u2019s focus is on quantum phenomena that reveal themselves in this unique class of materials.\u00a0Balandin\u2019s expertise and research interests cover a broad range, from solid-state physics theory to experimental investigation of advanced materials and fabrication of nano-devices with applications in electronics and energy conversion. His research group is internationally recognized for pioneering studies of graphene\u2019s thermal properties, discovery of unique features of phonon thermal transport in two-dimensional materials, and the first proposals and demonstrations of practical applications of graphene in thermal management of electronics.To give an example of the kind of innovative work that motivated the new research direction, the group recently published the details of a flexible polymer film filled with needle-like, quasi-one-dimensional threads that combines excellent electromagnetic shielding with ease of manufacture. Electromagnetic shielding prevents radio frequency interference in sensitive electronics.For the Vannevar Bush Faculty Fellowship project, Balandin and co-workers will investigate formation of charge-density-wave condensate in one-dimensional Van der Waals materials. Other topics of interest include one-dimensional materials with strong spin-orbit coupling, phonon confinement, and quantization effects.\u00a0The Vannevar Bush Faculty Fellowship is the Department of Defense\u2019s most prestigious single-investigator award and supports new, out-of-the box ideas where researcher creativity intersects with the unknown.Share this ArticleMedia ContactsTagsBourns College Of EngineeringDepartment Of Electrical And Computer Engineeringmaterials science and engineeringAlexander BalandinNanomaterialsScience / TechnologyRelated ArticlesScience / TechnologyStudy of perception and memory in older adults will improve understanding of dementiasScience / TechnologyA new water treatment technology could also help Mars explorersScience / TechnologyUCR joins forces with NASA on missions to VenusScience / TechnologyA new dimension in the quest to understand dark matter SearchUniversity of California, Riverside900 University Ave.            Riverside, CA 92521Tel: 951 827-1012UCR LibraryCampus StatusCampus StoreCareer OpportunitiesDiversityMaps and DirectionsVisit UCRUniversity of California, Riverside             900 University Ave.            Riverside, CA 92521                          tel: 951 827-0000                        email: webmaster@ucr.edu  Find UsFollow US:Related LinksUCR News ArchiveScience TodayServicio de Informaci\u00f3n en Espa\u00f1olUC Agricultural and Natural Resources newsUC NewsroomAvailable FeedsCreator State PodcastPrivacy PolicyTerms and Conditions\u00a9 2021 Regents of the University of CaliforniaSearch\u00d7Let us help you with your searchEnter your Search Criteria.Search All UCRSearch This SiteCancel"}, {"id": 75, "url": "https://www.ece.ucr.edu/news/2021/05/06/alexander-balandin-named-dod-vannevar-bush-faculty-fellow/", "html": "Access BCOE COVID-19 information and guidance.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Submit a return-to-work proposal.\u00a0 \u00a0Request a one-time visit to BCOE.\u00a0 Take the daily wellness check survey.Skip to main contentA to Z ListingCampus MapFind PeopleNewsSkip to main contentMarlan and Rosemary Bourns College of EngineeringSearchBCOE Departments & ProgramsMARLAN AND ROSEMARY BOURNS COLLEGE OF ENGINEERINGBioengineeringChemical and Environmental EngineeringComputer EngineeringComputer Science and EngineeringData ScienceElectrical and Computer EngineeringMaterials Science and EngineeringMechanical EngineernigOnline M.S. in EngineeringUC Riverside Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering We Engineer ExcellenceSearchUndergraduateProspectiveApply OnlineCurrentAdvisingNew Student OrientationProgram Requirements    Focus AreasProgramsElectrical EngineeringComputer EngineeringMaterials Science and EngineeringCoursesStudent ProjectsABETFinancial InformationGraduateProgram OverviewAdmissionsOverviewDomestic ApplicantsInternational ApplicantsECE UCR DifferenceRequest InfoApplyFAQContinuingAcademicsOverviewBS+MSMSEECENPhDResourcesGraduate Student ManualNew Student InformationGraduate Student Association GSACoursesPeopleFacultyCooperating FacultyResearch FacultyLecturersAdjunct FacultyStaffResearchAreas of ResearchOverviewCommunications, Signal Processing, and NetworkingComputer EngineeringControl and RoboticsIntelligent SystemsNanotechnology, Advanced Materials, and DevicesPower Systems and Smart GridResearch LabsOverviewCommunications, Signal Processing, and NetworkingComputer EngineeringControl and RoboticsIntelligent SystemsNanotechnology, Advanced Materials, and DevicesPower Systems and Smart GridResearch CentersAboutMessage from the ChairMission StatementHistoryFacts and FiguresBoard of AdvisorsEngagementStudent Clubs and OrganizationsOutreachStem Summer CampEventsNewsResearch HighlightsGivingOverviewGiving OpportunitiesEmploymentBCOE Departments & ProgramsMARLAN AND ROSEMARY BOURNS COLLEGE OF ENGINEERINGBioengineeringChemical and Environmental EngineeringComputer EngineeringComputer Science and EngineeringData ScienceElectrical and Computer EngineeringMaterials Science and EngineeringMechanical EngineernigOnline M.S. in EngineeringBreadcrumbLatest NewsMay 6th, 2021Alexander Balandin named DoD Vannevar Bush Faculty Fellow Alexander Balandin named DoD Vannevar Bush Faculty FellowMay 06, 2021 ECE Distinguished Professor Alexander Balandin has been awarded a 2021 Department of Defense DoD Vannevar Bush Faculty Fellowship\u00a0. The five-year, highly competitive fellowship is the DoD\u2019s most prestigious single-investigator award with up to $3 million in funding and \u201csupports new, out-of-the-box ideas where research creativity intersects with the unknown.\u201d Balandin was selected to conduct research in one-dimensional quantum materials.

The foundations of materials science and engineering are the basic sciences of physics, chemistry, and mathematics. An engineer working with the great variety of materials responses at the electrical, optical, magnetic, mechanical, and chemical levels must have a solid scientific foundation and breadth of basic knowledge from the physical sciences and engineering.Many applications today require broad-based materials knowledge. A materials engineer may specialize in a specific class of materials magnetic materials, nanostructured materials, polymers, biological materials, etc. or a specific area of materials science electrical properties, mechanical properties, materials processing, materials testing, etc., but should possess a broad background in materials science and engineering. Increased emphasis on cost, weight, and size reduction, while still improving product performance, creates challenges for monolithic materials, and opportunities for composites, nanostructures and other new materials. Miniaturization of components frequently is limited by the interactions of dissimilar materials at a microscopic and nanometer scale. A materials engineer must be able to optimize the overall performance of complex systems involving several materials.\u00a0[back to top]Materials Science and Engineering at the University of California - RiversideIn 2007, the Bourns College of Engineering BCOE established a new program and started to offer a Bachelor of Science degree in Materials Science and Engineering. The MSE program at UCR aims to provide fundamental knowledge for understanding of materials with the objective of predicting, modifying, and tailoring the properties of materials to achieve enhanced performance of the materials and devices based on these materials. This degree program is administered by the Materials Science and Engineering MSE Committee in Charge, which consists of Professor Alexander A. Balandin Department of Electrical Engineering, Professor Cengiz Ozkan Department of Mechanical Engineering, Professor Nosang Myung Department of Chemical and Environmental Engineering, Professor Mart Molle Department of Computer Science and Engineering and Professor Valentine Vullev Department of Bioengineering. The committee is chaired by Professor Balandin.The Committee in Charge, which consists of the representatives of each department in the Bourns College of Engineering, has the responsibility for approval and management of the Materials Science and Engineering courses. The teaching faculty for this interdepartmental program is drawn from the College of Engineering. The courses included in the MSE major curriculum have either MSE subject abbreviation or the department subject abbreviation, e.g., ME, CEE, EE, etc. Each department of the College of Engineering offers a focus area within the MSE program through a set of technical electives TE, which emphasize a certain aspect of materials science and engineering.During the first two years the students take general education courses mathematics; physics; chemistry; breadth requirements and the lower-division courses offered by the participating departments. A dedicated MSE course offered during the freshman year MSE 1: Fundamentals of Materials Science and Engineering, introduces the students to the basics of the materials science and engineering. During the third year, the students take the materials core courses. The core courses are offered jointly by all departments.\u00a0[back to top]Bachelor of Science in Materials Science and Engineering degree major requirements\u00a0Suggested course planMaterials Science and Engineering as an Interdisciplinary FieldThe MSE program at the Bourns College of Engineering is truly interdisciplinary, cutting across departmental and collegiate lines. The faculty members from various departments and with different backgrounds participate in the program. BCOE has a substantial number of faculty members who carry out experimental, theoretical and computational research in materials science and engineering. The MSE program is synergetic with the campus interdisciplinary nanotechnology efforts and investments. The MSE program at UCR is very different from the existing materials programs in other UC campuses and nearby universities. It is the only undergraduate program that involves all departments of the College of Engineering. The program structure implemented at UCR emphasizes the interdisciplinary nature of the field and encourages interdepartmental cooperation.The students enrolled in the MSE program benefit from the unique research facilities existing and currently under development at UCR. These facilities include the materials synthesis and characterization resources available in the Department of Bioengineering, Department of Chemical and Environmental Engineering, Department of Electrical Engineering and the Department of Mechanical Engineering. The Center for Nanoscale Science and Engineering CNSE and the Central Facility for Advanced Microscopy and Microanalysis CFAMM offer additional instrumentation, which can be used in the student training. Modern materials science and engineering involves a substantial computational component, i.e., computational materials science. The MSE students benefit from the computational resources available in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Department of Electrical Engineering, and the campus-wide computational facilities.\u00a0\u00a0[back to top]SearchUniversity of California, Riverside900 University Ave.            Riverside, CA 92521Tel: 951 827-1012UCR LibraryCampus StatusCampus StoreCareer OpportunitiesDiversityMaps and DirectionsVisit UCRMaterials Science and Engineering Program             313 Materials Science & Engineering Building            900 University Ave.             Riverside, CA 92521              tel: 951 827-3383                        email: mse-program@engr.ucr.edu Follow US:Visit BCOEs Facebook page external site: FacebookFollow BCOE on Twitter external site: TwitterVisit BCOEs YouTube channel external site: YouTubeFollow UCR on Instagram external site: InstagramJoin the LinkedIn alumni group external site: LinkedInVisit BCOEs Flickr gallery external site: FlickrSubscribe to MSE news via RSSPrivacy PolicyTerms and Conditions\u00a9 2021 Regents of the University of California\u00d7Let us help you with your searchEnter your Search Criteria.Search All UCRSearch This SiteCancel"}, {"id": 85, "url": "https://connect.ucr.edu/register/ECE/", "html": "This website uses scripting to enhance your browsing experience.

If approved by the Systemwide Coordinating Committee on Graduate Affairs and the University of California UC Office of the Provost, the new M.S. degree could accept its first cohort of students early as Fall 2021. The program would become the first Master\u2019s Robotics program within the UC system.\u00a0 \u00a0Robotics is a fast-growing field driven by recent advances in artificial intelligence research and technology development and presents a wealth of career opportunities in industries such as manufacturing, logistics, health care, public safety, government, and the military.At the National Science Foundation NSF, robotics is at the forefront of multiple initiatives, including NSF\u2019s 10 Big Ideas, Emerging Frontiers in Research and Innovation which is focused on soft robotics, and the National Robotics Initiative and Cyber-Physical Systems program. Robotics is also a critical part of many research programs at the U.S. Department of Defense, which plans to invest over $2 billion over the next five years in artificial intelligence research.Currently, BCOE offers coursework in relevant sub-areas of robotics: mechanical engineering offers courses in robot design and control, electrical engineering in control and machine learning, computer engineering in real-time system design, and computer science in machine learning and data mining.In response to the student demand of these popular BCOE courses, if approved, the M.S. Robotics curriculum will provide a more holistic understanding of robotics and culminate in an interdisciplinary training in the design, construction, and deployment of robots and autonomous systems. The program will be open to students with undergraduate degrees from the above-mentioned departments, and potentially to those with backgrounds in physics or mathematics. \u00a0The job growth outlook and salary opportunities for robotics are promising. In its report \"The Future of Jobs 2018,\" the World Economic Forum projects that artificial intelligence could create 58 million new jobs globally by 2022. Whats more, LinkedIn has\u00a0seen hiring for artificial\u00a0intelligence specialists increase\u00a0by 74 percent in the past four years, and hiring for robotics engineers increase by 40 percent.\u00a0By earning an advanced educational degree, BCOE engineering students can greatly increase their earning potential for the long-term. The National Research Council states that \u201csalaries of master\u2019s degree holders in science and engineering have grown faster over the past 10 years than salaries of baccalaureate or doctorate holders.\u201dMore updates and details of the program are expected to follow, pending additional approval by UC entities.Share ThisMore NewsSearchUniversity of California, Riverside900 University Ave.            Riverside, CA 92521Tel: 951 827-1012UCR LibraryCampus StatusCampus StoreCareer OpportunitiesDiversityMaps and DirectionsVisit UCRMarlan and Rosemary Bourns College of Engineering             446 Winston Chung Hall            900 University Ave.             Riverside, CA 92521              tel: 951 827-5190                 fax: 951 827-3188         email: news@engr.ucr.edu Related LinksBCOE Available Conference Rooms and Technology ResourcesGive to BournsIntranetFaculty ResourcesMarketing ResourcesSystemsFollow US:Visit BCOEs Facebook page external site: FacebookFollow BCOE on Twitter external site: TwitterVisit BCOEs YouTube channel external site: YouTubeVisit BCOEs Flickr gallery external site: FlickrSubscribe to BCOE News via RSS FeedPrivacy PolicyTerms and Conditions\u00a9 2021 Regents of the University of California\u00d7Let us help you with your searchEnter your Search Criteria.Search All UCRSearch This SiteCancel"}, {"id": 88, "url": "https://twitter.com/ucr_ece?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw/", "html": "JavaScript is not available.We\u2019ve detected that JavaScript is disabled in this browser.

The vital research collaborations that this magnificent new facility is designed to foster and accelerate will hasten the discovery of new knowledge ... that will make life better regionally, nationally and globally.\u201d\u2014 UCI Chancellor Howard GillmanTackling the world\u2019s biggest problemsThe great challenges of the 21st century \u2013 such as disease and climate change \u2013 will not be solved by solitary thinkers. Tackling such problems requires the collaboration of teams that include engineers, biologists, mathematicians, climate scientists and other specialists. Interdisciplinary research is the future, and UCI \u2013 long known for this synergistic approach \u2013 has just taken a huge step forward in this realm with the debut of its Interdisciplinary Science and Engineering Building.Read Press Release  \u00a0Read UCI Magazine Feature  \u00a0Listen to the Podcast \u201cAs ground was being broken for this fabulous new facility, Susan and I were hoping for a structure that would provide an engine for cross-disciplinary research and innovations to benefit society, and we feel very strongly that goal has been achieved \u2014 Henry Samueli, co-founder of semiconductor maker Broadcom Corp.\u201dISEB videoInterdisciplinary explorersThe six-story edifice, featuring more than 200,000 square feet of laboratory and office space, will be occupied by faculty, researchers and students from a wide range of departments and schools.EngineeringBiomedical engineeringChemical and biomolecular engineeringCivil and environmental engineeringElectrical engineering and computer scienceMaterials science and engineeringInformation and computer sciencesSoftware engineergingData Science InitiativeCenter for Statistical ConsultingCybersecurity Policy & Research InstitutePhysical sciencesChemistryEarth system scienceMathematicsPhysics and astronomySchool of MedicineNSF Secure and Trustworthy Cyberspace Frontiers programNSF-Simons Research CentersDesigned to be greenNatural light, energy efficiency and sustainable construction are hallmarks of the ISEB. Air quality is maintained via real-time monitoring and interior spaces are suffused with natural light or, where necessary, LEDs. The building is expected to outperform the California Energy Code by more than 55 percent.Innovation is in UCIs DNAEver since UCI was founded \u2013 and built around a circle, not the typical college quadrangle \u2013 the university has shown a commitment to bringing together different academic disciplines to share knowledge for the benefit of society.Jacob Deyell Dr. Albert R. La Spada, director of UCI\u2019s Institute for Neurotherapeutics, and members of his 14-person research team \u2013 including graduate student Jacob Deyell pictured \u2013 were among the ISEB\u2019s earliest occupants in the fall. The group focuses on neurodegenerative diseases such as Huntington\u2019s and Parkinson\u2019s.Xiangmin Xu Xiangmin Xu, professor of anatomy & neurobiology and director of UCI\u2019s Center for Neural Circuit Mapping, is moving into the ISEB with a team of 18 researchers who that focuses on research to helping to unravel the mechanisms underlying several common disorders, such as lazy eye and Alzheimer\u2019s disease.Nadia Leonard Postdoctoral scholar Nadia Leonard is a member of Jenny Yang\u2019s research group.Ming Ho Biomedical engineering graduate student researcher Ming Ho works in the lab of Chang C. Liu\u2019s lab. Liu is an associate professor of biomedical engineering, chemistry and molecular biology & biochemistry.Pramod Khargonekar, UCI vice chancellor for research Pramod Khargonekar, UCI vice chancellor for research, says: \u201cWe thought that if we could bring people from various subfields of engineering, physical sciences, and information and computer sciences together and have them converge on major problems in energy, environment, climate, and health, then perhaps we could make transformative advances on our biggest challenges. That\u2019s how this building concept has come together.\u201dISEB interior The ISEB features numerous interaction areas in a variety of sizes and configurations. These spaces are designed to provide a comfortable, casual setting for relaxation and conversations among students, faculty and staff working in the building.ISEB open-air gathering and event space On the fourth floor of the ISEB, a symposium room is placed next to an open-air gathering and event space. The building designers envisioned faculty and students taking part in a lecture and then congregating in the reception area to discuss new ideas and approaches to grand challenges.ISEB exterior The ISEB, recently constructed on the south side of the UCI campus, brings more than 200,000 square feet of new laboratory, office and conference space to the university. The ISEB was designed from the ground up to foster collaboration among physical scientists, engineers and computer scientists so that they can address the most difficult problems facing humanity.Michael Green, interim dean of The Henry Samueli School of Engineering On the pressing need for additional laboratory and office space on the UCI campus, which the ISEB is alleviating, Michael Green, interim dean of The Henry Samueli School of Engineering, says: \u201cWe grew from 100 tenure-track and tenured faculty in 2010 to 155 in 2020, the result of concerted efforts to bring a number of world-renowned experts to the school, but our laboratory capacity did not grow in order to meet this expansion.\u201dJames Bullock, dean of the School of Physical Sciences James Bullock, dean of the School of Physical Sciences, says: \u201cWith this building we took a different view: Rather than arranging by departments, we\u2019re organizing by research question. Energy, climate and health are not the domain of a single department or school, so we said, \u2018Why not group together folks with the same broad goals, give them space to interact, and let them bring to bear diverse tools and approaches to tackle the biggest problems of our age?\u2019\"Susan and Henry Samueli Broadcom Corp. co-founder Henry Samueli, who, through the Samueli Foundation, provided seed financing for the construction of the ISEB, says: \u201cAs ground was being broken for this fabulous new facility, Susan and I were hoping for a structure that would provide an engine for cross-disciplinary research and innovations to benefit society, and we feel very strongly that goal has been achieved.\u201dRelated researchUCI team uses machine learning to help tell which wildfires will burn out of controlUCI\u2019s Center for Neural Circuit Mapping is redrawing our understanding of mechanisms underlying several common disordersSue & Bill Gross Stem Cell Research Center celebrates 10 years of innovationNSF grants $18 million to UCI for materials science and engineering centerUCI researchers: Climate change will alter the position of the Earth\u2019s tropical rain beltUCI scientists project northward expansion of Valley fever by end of 21st centuryFacebookTwitterYouTubeInstagramFlickrUCI GmailWebmailEEEWork at UCIEmergency PreparednessDisability ServicesOffice of the ChancellorUniversity of CaliforniaFeedbackPrivacy NoticeMedia InquiriesAccreditation InformationClery ActUniversity of California, IrvineIrvine, CA 92697 949-824-5011 \u00a9\u00a02021\u00a0UC\u00a0Regents"}, {"id": 118, "url": "https://athenaolympiaduci.wixsite.com/home/", "html": "\u00a0This site was designed with the .com website builder.

The UC Irvine research team is led by Dr. Chenyang \u201cSunny\u201d Jiang, Professor and Chair of the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering. This project was identified as a high-priority research need during WRF\u2019s recent\u00a0International Water Research Summit on Environmental Surveillance of COVID-19 Indicators. In addition to WRF funds, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation contributed funding to support this project.\u00a0The primary goal of this study is to optimize sampling design to best capture SARS-CoV-2 signals in wastewater sewage and septage so that signal detection and quantification can serve as both an early warning for COVID-19 outbreaks and reflect epidemic severity in the community. The research team will base its study on the sewage collection and treatment systems within the County of Los Angeles. This location has the advantage of enabling the detection, variability, and dynamic range of SARS-CoV-2 genes to be assessed at the variety of scales required for the project.

For these candidates, we will base secondary application decisions on the information that is available to us at the time of the application.\u00a0\u00a0For all applicants, we will make decisions regarding interviews without consideration of the MCAT score.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0We have a strong preference for\u00a0applicants to have taken the MCAT before we make final, post-interview\u00a0admissions decisions for the entering class of 2022.\u00a0 \u00a0We may decide to consider an applicant for an admission decision without an MCAT, on a case-by-case basis, if they were prevented from taking it due to an insurmountable barrier or extenuating circumstance despite a good-faith effort, exclusively per our determination. We will vet applicants in this position for an admissions decision without an MCAT only after they have completed an interview, and not beforehand.\u00a0\u00a0If an applicant was able to sit for an MCAT exam but\u00a0feels their MCAT performance or ability to take the MCAT was significantly adversely affected by a pandemic-related issue, we will allow a short statement describing that hardship or adversity to be appended to their secondary application.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 All applicants to UC San Diego School of Medicine must submit an AMCAS application during the official application time period of May 27, 2021\u00a0to October 15, 2021. Applicants may begin working on their application as early as May 3, 2021, but will not be able to submit until May 27. \rDeadline extensions cannot be granted for submission of this application.- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -Policy regarding Pass/No Pass and On-Line coursework due to\u00a0COVID-19 impactThe UCSD School of Medicine will accept grades of Pass/No Pass for all coursework for Winter 2020, Spring 2020, the entire 2020\u00a0 - 2021 academic year, and Summer 2021\u00a0 \u00a0We have always accepted grades from online courses and will continue to do so.\u00a0\u00a0Explanation of \"rolling\" admissionsWe are aware that the perception of many applicants is that if you dont apply very early in the cycle, you are hurting your chances for admission.\u00a0 \u00a0This is not true and in fact has never been true for UCSD.\u00a0 \u00a0We do have \"rolling\" admissions.\u00a0\u00a0 But, what rolling admissions means from our perspective is that we plan to make a small number of offers spread throughout the year...it does NOT mean that we make all of our offers in October and November and reject any applicants that happen to be reviewed later.\u00a0 \u00a0It is very much in\u00a0our interest to try to form the best possible incoming class, and thus we do not make any decisions based on how early or how late we receive or review an application.\u00a0\u00a0 We leave plenty of room for strong applicants that apply later in the cycle.- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\u00a0Applicants will be notified by email if approved for a secondary application.

Please visit the \rAAMC for more details about this service.A minimum of three letters are required from individuals who can provide a well considered evaluation of your qualifications for the medical profession. We will also accept a single \"Committee Letter\" compiled by your undergraduate schools pre-med advising office in lieu of the three letter minimum. We accept a maximum of five letters for the MD program, and a maximum of seven letters for the MD/PhD program.\u00a0 \u00a0If you are applying to the MD/PhD program, please note that a minimum of two letters should be from research-related facultyLetters from faculty at your four-year undergraduate institution are encouraged but not required. Letters can come from any source, including but not limited to: course instructors, research mentors, clinical faculty, work supervisors, non-faculty practicing physicians.All communication is through e-mail.

Each of their stories begins differently\u2014from an international childhood spanning over a dozen countries to discovering a love of learning within an isolated jail cell\u2014but their paths all converged at UC San Diego. Their resilience and accomplishments will be recognized during a series of 10 in-person Commencement ceremonies held June 12-13. Across majors and schools, graduates demonstrate a commitment to their community and a genuine desire to make a difference in the lives of others. Here, the first of a two-part series about the Class of 2021.Sean BeardenPhysics doctoral recipientAt 19 years old, Sean Bearden found himself facing an eight-year jail sentence for a violent felony. While isolated in prison, he was drawn to reading for the first time in his life despite a history of indifference to education. When his mother discovered\u00a0Bearden\u2019s change of heart towards education, she began to research distance learning programs and learned of\u00a0an associate\u2019s degree program available through Ohio University. At the time immersed in quantum mechanics, Bearden jumped at the chance to enroll in remote math, science and physics courses.After being released in mid-2011 and transitioning to work at a collection agency, Bearden aligned on the path he set for himself to achieve a doctoral degree in physics. Though initially somewhat insecure about starting an undergraduate degree at 26 years old, he realized he had cultivated study habits and discipline in prison that his younger peers had not. After completing a bachelor\u2019s degree, he won a National Science Foundation fellowship and was accepted to UC San Diego as a Sloan Scholar.\u201cThe pursuit of a doctorate felt like my only opportunity to overshadow my past,\u201d explained Bearden. \u201cI was a nontraditional student who made it into one of the top doctoral programs in the country; I could not let the opportunity slip away. I knew a doctorate would change my life.\u201dAt UC San Diego, Bearden designed and employed novel, nonlinear dynamical systems, known as digital memcomputing machines, and received the UC President\u2019s Dissertation Year Fellowship for his research. Since finishing his degree, he is working in data science and quantitative finance and plans to stay active with the UC San Diego community, participating in Grad Talks and mentoring students.Cieara SimmonsEleanor Roosevelt College, Global HealthWhen the COVID-19 pandemic started, UC San Diego\u2019s Basic Needs Hub became an even more critical resource to the student population. But the team had to be innovative in serving students safely. As a Basic Needs Assistant, Cieara Simmons was among the first contacts for students reaching out for food, housing and financial support. She explained that her best memories during her time at UC San Diego happened during the two years she served in the role.\u201cGrowing up in a low-income household sprouted my awareness of assistance programs and their purpose,\u201d explained Simmons. \u201cBenefiting from the center as a sophomore encouraged me to apply, so I could also help others and increase awareness about basic needs. Being able to converse with students at the center and learn more about them as individuals continuously motivates me to keep doing the work.\u201dAccording to Simmons, one of the most effective pandemic pivots at the Hub is the option to order and pick up personal care items. She helped book over 1,000 appointments in the past year for students who could no longer access hygiene essentials. The program offers a wide variety of free products each week, from toothpaste and shampoo to sunscreen and small first aid kits. \u201cHearing students\u2019 thanks and appreciation for the work we do makes it so worth it!\u201d said Simmons.After graduation, Simmons plans to return to the Bay Area and serve as a resident payee at the Tenderloin Housing Clinic, which works to prevent tenant displacement, expand San Francisco\u2019s low-cost housing and provide legal assistance to low-income tenants. After the gap year, her goal is to earn a master\u2019s degree in social work and continue to make a difference.Natalia Rossana Men\u00e9ndezMuir College, Cognitive and Behavioral NeuroscienceNatalia Rossana Men\u00e9ndez has mastered the skill of adapting. She received a global education growing up after living in eight countries and attending 13 schools. As a Mexican international student, Men\u00e9ndez explains that while she was exposed to numerous cultures and people at a very young age, it was difficult leaving friends behind. Amid constant change, she found stability in her family, who prepared her to accept challenges as they come and expect mistakes but keep moving forward with an open heart.\u201cMy parents taught me the importance of perspective,\u201d she said. \u201cInstead of \u2018hitting a wall,\u2019 I was \u2018getting over a speedbump.\u2019 Obstacles in life aren\u2019t meant to stop you or prevent you from reaching your path;\u00a0sometimes you just need to slow down to see the bigger picture. I think this gave me a very unique and interesting point of view about life.\u201dA cognitive and behavioral neuroscience major, Men\u00e9ndez is passionate about helping those with neurodegenerative diseases. As part of her honors thesis, she is working with Professor David Kirsh to design environments that positively impact neuropsychological states for patients with Alzheimer\u2019s disease and dementia. By intentionally adjusting color, temperature, brightness and noise, the goal is to improve cognition and comfort levels.Men\u00e9ndez has also dedicated her time as a volunteer research assistant at the Veterans Medical Research Foundation at the VA Medical Center. By working with patients who have Alzheimer\u2019s disease, she has a better understanding of how vast the opportunities are in her chosen field and how much she enjoys working closely with cognitively impaired patients. After graduation she plans to continue her volunteer work and apply for a neuroscience Ph.D. program.Efran MartinezMechanical Engineering, Warren CollegeEfran Martinez, pictured in the race car, with members of Triton Racing team after finishing 13th at Formula SAE national competition at Lincoln, Nebraska in 2019.Each year, a team of UC San Diego engineering students designs, fabricates, and tests an open-wheel race car for the national Formula Society of Automotive Engineers competition. The prospect of gaining real-world experience and working alongside a team of peers sounded exciting to Efran Martinez when he began his sophomore year. After joining the team and exploring different roles, he became chassis lead and oversaw the design, manufacturing and integration of components such as brakes, safety and frame. Martinez became president during his senior year and oversaw the entire project, with special focus on increasing opportunities for new members.\u201cAfter hearing about Triton Racing and seeing a student-designed performance racecar, I knew it was something I wanted to be a part of,\u201d said Martinez, a mechanical engineering major at Warren College. \u201cWhile I had essentially no hands-on engineering experience and very little knowledge about cars at the time, I was very eager to learn and contribute to the project.\u201dIn addition to his leadership role in Triton Racing, Martinez served as Associated Students Engineering Senator. As a representative, he increased awareness about engineering student projects and secured external funding resources and sponsorships so that students did not have to contribute their own funds for activities such as traveling to competitions. The goal was to ensure teams had equal access to all hands-on learning experiences, no matter their financial circumstances.Following graduation, Martinez will begin a rotational program with Rivian, an adventurous electric vehicle company, where he hopes to contribute to vehicle structures and help drive the transition towards sustainable transportation.\u00a0ShareFacebookTwitterLinkedinRedditEmailPrintKeep up with campus news by subscribing to This\u00a0Week\u00a0@\u00a0UC\u00a0San\u00a0Diego More This WeekSubscribe to This WeekPrevious IssuesAbout Our CampusCampus ProfileCampus ToursContact UCPAHomeNewsAll NewsReturn to Learn ProgramCOVID-19Arts & CultureAthleticsBusiness & EconomicsCampus & CommunityDiversity & InclusionHealth & MedicinePhilanthropyResearchScience & EngineeringSociety & PoliticsSlideshowsThis Week NewsmagazineCurrent IssuePast IssuesAbout This WeekSubscribeResources for MediaFaculty ExpertsMedia ContactsCampus ProfileCampus ImagesStudio Ten 300LogoUniversity NameSearchThis SiteSearch NewsSearch UC San DiegoSearch Faculty/StaffcloseSearch NewsSearchSearchSearch UC San DiegoSearchSearchSearch Faculty and StaffSearchSearchcloseFacebookTwitterYouTubeInstagramImportant informationEmergency StatusDisability ResourcesPrinciples of CommunityEquity, Diversity and InclusionUC San Diego9500 Gilman Dr., La Jolla, CA 92093 \t\t\t\t858 534-2230Copyright \u00a9 2021\t\t\t\tRegents of the University of California. \t\t\t\tAll rights reserved.TermsAccessibilityContactDivisions and SchoolsArts & HumanitiesBiological SciencesJacobs School of EngineeringPhysical SciencesRady School of ManagementSchool of Global Policy and StrategySchool of MedicineScripps Institution of OceanographySkaggs School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical SciencesSocial SciencesThe Herbert Wertheim School of Public Health and Human Longevity ScienceOther University SitesAdmissionsAlumniAthleticsChancellorDiversityExtensionGivingHealth SystemLibraryMapsPreuss School"}, {"id": 143, "url": "https://sixtieth.ucsd.edu/", "html": "Skip to the main contentBlinkA-Z Site Index      Search UC San Diego   Search Faculty/Staff     Apply Now Toggle navigation  Search UC San Diego  Search Faculty/Staff     About   Visiting & ToursHistoryNewsJobs @ UC San DiegoOffice of the ChancellorUC San Diego HealthEconomic Impact ReportAcademics  TritonLinkUndergraduate Degrees & ProgramsGraduate Degrees & ProgramsCollegesStudent Academic SuccessDigital LearningExtensionLibraryAdmissions and Aid  First-Year AdmissionsTransfer AdmissionsGraduate AdmissionsSchool of MedicineSkaggs School of PharmacyFinancial AidResearch and Innovation  Research InitiativesStudent OpportunitiesCampus Life  OrganizationsDiversityEventsStudent SupportStudy AbroadCareer & InternshipAthleticsSupport UC San Diego  AlumniGivingFoundationBlinkA-Z Site IndexAboutVisiting & ToursHistoryNewsJobs @ UC San DiegoOffice of the ChancellorUC San Diego HealthEconomic Impact ReportAcademicsTritonLinkUndergraduate Degrees & ProgramsGraduate Degrees & ProgramsCollegesStudent Academic SuccessDigital LearningExtensionLibraryAdmissions  and Aid First-Year AdmissionsTransfer AdmissionsGraduate AdmissionsSchool of MedicineSkaggs School of PharmacyFinancial AidResearch and  Innovation Research InitiativesStudent OpportunitiesCampus LifeOrganizationsDiversityEventsStudent SupportStudy AbroadCareer & InternshipAthleticsSupport  UC San Diego AlumniGivingFoundation60 years of creating better tomorrowsSix decades ago, a group of like-minded changemakers pioneered a school free from the constraints of tradition and expectation.

Yet many undergraduate students\u2014especially those from underrepresented communities or who are the first in their families to attend college\u2014lack the necessary mentorship, tools and financial resources to navigate this process.To better support students interested in graduate studies in neurosciences, UC San Diego\u2019s Kavli Institute for Brain and Mind, in coordination with student organization Colors of the Brain, has created the CoB-KIBM Scholars Program. This 10-week summer research program connects students to a lab, where they will gain research experience and receive mentorship from a faculty member. There is a $5,000 stipend to cover living expenses.Kavli Institute for Brain and Mind KIBM is a multidisciplinary research unit that seeks to understand precisely what the relationship is between the cellular machinery that collectively makes up the brain and the resulting behaviors called \u201cthe mind.\u201d Created through a donation from the Kavli Foundation, researchers from UC San Diego and the Salk Institute for Biological Studies further investigate neuroscience in areas including autism spectrum disorders, cystinosis, neurogenesis and learning.Co-director of KIBM Yishi Jin felt the scholarship aligned with the institute\u2019s mission to nurture the talents of students interested in neuroscience research. \u201cWe recognize and appreciate the community outreach efforts that Colors of the Brain has been doing. By creating this scholarship, we can provide the students an opportunity to fully enjoy their first research experience and to show them that a career in science is within their grasp,\" said Jin, a professor of neurobiology in the Division of Biological Sciences.Colors of the Brain CoB is a student organization created in 2016 by Christian Cazares, Maribel Patino, Pamela Riviere and Kevin White\u2014all graduate students in the Neurosciences Graduate Program or the Department of Cognitive Science. CoB\u2019s mission is to provide undergraduate students from historically underrepresented backgrounds with graduate student mentors who have gone through the transition into graduate research programs.Although the organization provides assistance with graduate school applications and guidance on navigating the research landscape at UC San Diego, they couldn\u2019t provide access to a faculty lab or financial assistance. When KIBM approached them looking for ideas of how to support students, the scholars program was born.One requirement for the fellowship was the opposite of most others: the committee preferred if applicants didn\u2019t have previous research experience. This was meant to prioritize students who do not have the access or means to navigate the research landscape on their own. Nearly 50 undergraduates with an expressed interest in neuroscience applied for the scholarship. Originally, KIBM agreed to fund three scholars for the summer, but when the scholarship committee said they had found four remarkable candidates, the institute agreed to fund an additional student.Dean of Undergraduate Research David Artis believes this fellowship meets an ongoing need many students face.\u201cDiversity issues in STEM are persistent and often it\u2019s the undergraduate who becomes discouraged or doesn\u2019t have the guidance to realize the necessary steps to take toward a career,\u201d he said. \u201cThis fellowship gives students a wonderful opportunity to gain valuable lab experience, receive faculty mentorship and seriously consider what a career in neuroscience might look like for them.\u201dStudents will spend the summer working full time in a lab either at UC San Diego or Salk. They will have several one-on-one sessions with a faculty mentor and at the end of the program will write a short report, present their work at a poster session and prepare an elevator pitch. Although their work will vary depending on their interests, all scholars will learn basic research skills such as how to read scientific literature, how to write a research paper and how to use basic computational methods. Scholars will also be paired with graduate mentors and participate in teambuilding events throughout the summer.When asked why CoB created a scholarship that focused on underrepresented groups, graduate student mentor Minerva Contreras, who is also assistant program coordinator for the scholar program, said that \u201cthe graduate student mentors in CoB are members of underrepresented communities, so their challenges really resonate with us. We know what it\u2019s like to realize as a junior that you should have tried to get research experience as a sophomore. We know what it\u2019s like to turn down summer research jobs because you can\u2019t afford to work for free. We wanted to remove these barriers, uplift these students and create a diverse pipeline of future neuroscientists.\u201dThe inaugural CoB-KIBM Scholars are:Eman Abdulkadir is majoring in Cognitive and Behavioral Neuroscience. She is interested in behavioral, developmental, decision-making and cognitive neuroscience. Originally from Ethiopia, she is interested in combining cultural and behavioral trends in neuroscience, such as the neurobiological effects of increased caffeine consumption in the Ethiopian culture. \u201cI applied to the scholars program because it was designed for students like me who haven\u2019t had the opportunity to explore their interests in neuroscience research,\u201d she said.Lauren Valdez is majoring in Neurobiology. She is interested in researching the molecular mechanisms that underlie many neurodegenerative diseases along with the altered neural circuitry that contributes to some mental disorders. \u201cI applied to this program because I believe they offered the best opportunities and was deeply moved by their commitment to give underrepresented students with no previous research experience a chance at neuroscience research,\u201d she said.Khoa Nguyen is majoring in General Biology. He is interested in researching connections in the brain between cells and neurons and the signaling mechanisms that regulate the formation of the blood-brain barrier during development. Originally from Vietnam, he said, \u201cBeing the first in my family to go to college, I don\u2019t have anyone to provide guidance during my academic career. This is a great program that will connect me with mentors, so that I can successfully start my neuroscience career.\u201dMarissa Evans is majoring in Human Biology. She is passionate about mentoring underrepresented students in STEM, as well as improving access to health education in Black communities. Her research interests include exploring the extent to which generational/racial trauma affects marginalized communities. Evans said, \u201cI applied to the scholars program because it looked really fun. As a naturally curious person, I felt this was the first step to getting into research and exploring some lifelong questions I\u2019ve had about neuroscience.\u201dShareFacebookTwitterLinkedinRedditEmailPrintKeep up with campus news by subscribing to This\u00a0Week\u00a0@\u00a0UC\u00a0San\u00a0DiegoAbout Our CampusCampus ProfileCampus ToursContact UCPAHomeNewsAll NewsReturn to Learn ProgramCOVID-19Arts & CultureAthleticsBusiness & EconomicsCampus & CommunityDiversity & InclusionHealth & MedicinePhilanthropyResearchScience & EngineeringSociety & PoliticsSlideshowsThis Week NewsmagazineCurrent IssuePast IssuesAbout This WeekSubscribeResources for MediaFaculty ExpertsMedia ContactsCampus ProfileCampus ImagesStudio Ten 300LogoUniversity NameSearchThis SiteSearch NewsSearch UC San DiegoSearch Faculty/StaffcloseSearch NewsSearchSearchSearch UC San DiegoSearchSearchSearch Faculty and StaffSearchSearchcloseFacebookTwitterYouTubeInstagramImportant informationEmergency StatusDisability ResourcesPrinciples of CommunityEquity, Diversity and InclusionUC San Diego9500 Gilman Dr., La Jolla, CA 92093 \t\t\t\t858 534-2230Copyright \u00a9 2021\t\t\t\tRegents of the University of California. \t\t\t\tAll rights reserved.TermsAccessibilityContactDivisions and SchoolsArts & HumanitiesBiological SciencesJacobs School of EngineeringPhysical SciencesRady School of ManagementSchool of Global Policy and StrategySchool of MedicineScripps Institution of OceanographySkaggs School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical SciencesSocial SciencesThe Herbert Wertheim School of Public Health and Human Longevity ScienceOther University SitesAdmissionsAlumniAthleticsChancellorDiversityExtensionGivingHealth SystemLibraryMapsPreuss School"}, {"id": 150, "url": "https://ucsdnews.ucsd.edu/feature/social-justice-as-part-of-the-remedy-for-what-ails-us/", "html": "NEWSUC San DiegoUC San Diego News CenterMENUThis Week @ UC San DiegoBy Scott LaFeeJun 03, 2021SubscribeSocial Justice as Part of the Remedy for What Ails UsNew center in Sanford Institute for Empathy and Compassion focuses on issues in health careEliminating racial inequity demands empathy and compassion, but also social justice.The newest center within the T. Denny Sanford Institute for Empathy and Compassion at UC San Diego will have that focus, created to identify, understand and resolve social justice issues in health care that primarily affect racial and ethnic minorities, women, LGBTQ and underserved communities.Gentry Patrick\u201cAcross this country and throughout society, we face extraordinary challenges regarding racial injustice, especially those impacting marginalized members of our communities,\u201d said Gentry Patrick, a professor of neurobiology in the Division of Biological Sciences and the newly named director of the Center for Empathy and Social Justice in Human Health within the Sanford Institute.\u201cHealth care is not exempt. Indeed, building social justice within health care is absolutely critical to our well-being as individuals and as a society. It requires, of course, advancing the ideals of empathy and compassion, but it also means effectively parsing their neurobiological underpinnings, so that we can translate that empirical research into effective, beneficial social practices.\u201cBut how do we do that if we do not expand and deepen the presence and participation of those most afflicted? We need to better attract underrepresented minorities, i.e. Black Indigenous People of Color BIPOC into the fields of science, medicine and technology, which fuel and sustain modern health care. We need to train young people to build a new and better world that looks more like them.\u201dIt is no easy task, said Patrick. It demands action, clear-eyed and carefully planned.Dr. Evonne Kaplan-Liss\u201cWe have seen how the disadvantaged suffer; we have learned all too well about at least some of the everyday indignities that confront them. We hear their collective voices calling for change and it is no longer enough to claim awareness and extend kind gestures, but otherwise sit on the sidelines, an act of complicity.\u201dPatrick said the overarching mission of the new center will be to erect the foundations and provide the impetus for creating new generations of well-trained professionals in science, technology, education and medicine, drawn from currently underrepresented minorities. He noted current efforts are mixed and often falling short: According to a 2019 survey by the Association of American Medical Colleges, only 5 percent of practicing physicians in the United States are Black. In contrast, Blacks comprise almost 14 percent of the total U.S. population.Success, said Patrick, will involve sequential and concurrent steps, beginning with public conversations to define disparities and engage a diverse community of scholars and health care workers in finding necessary remedies.It will involve collaborating with and leveraging the work and resources of the other centers within the institute, and partnering with researchers across UC San Diego, in the schools of medicine, pharmacy and public health and in divisions across campus.Lisa Eyler\u201cThe center will support neuroscience-based approaches into the neurobiology of empathy and compassion, especially with respect to addressing the brain basis of self-identity and the biological and social bases for discrimination and racism,\u201d states the center\u2019s foundational white paper.There will be efforts to inform educators about curricular design and training in health care to convert research into practices that combat racism, and reframe the debate about health care disparities in terms of empathy and social justice.\u201cThis will require many facets of human endeavor,\u201d said Patrick, \u201cand the participation of faculty across many disciplines. But most importantly, it must focus on increased awareness, knowledge, access and success of underserved and under-represented minorities in STEM and health care professions.\u201dMultiple centersThe Sanford Institute for Empathy and Compassion was established in 2019 with a $100 million gift from South Dakota businessman and philanthropist T. Denny Sanford, who had earlier donated to the creation of the Sanford Stem Cell Clinical Center in 2013 and the Sanford Consortium of Regenerative Medicine in 2008.\u201cI have been inspired by the work and teachings of the Dalai Lama, whose interest in the intersection where science and faith meet is deep and profound,\u201d said Sanford at the institute\u2019s launch. \u201cI have had the opportunity to see how grace, humanity and kindness can change people and the world. This gift extends that vision. Doctors work in a world where compassion is essential, but often lost in the harsh realities of modern medicine. If we can help medical professionals preserve and promote their compassion, based on the findings of hard science, the world can be a happier, healthier place.\u201dCinnamon S. BlossIn the roughly two years since its beginning, the institute has taken root, building out its mission and infrastructure, bringing together the necessary parts and people\u2014much of it in the midst of a global pandemic.\u201cIf ever there has been a moment in history that highlighted humanity\u2019s need for empathy and compassion, this last year was it,\u201d said Dr. William Mobley, the institute\u2019s interim director and professor of neurosciences.Apart from the new Center for Empathy and Social Justice in Human Health under Patrick, there are five other centers:The Center for Compassionate Communication, headed by Dr. Evonne Kaplan-Liss, focuses on developing evidence-based training in interpersonal communication in health care.\tEffective communication between health care providers and patients is the centerpiece of compassionate health care,\u201d said Liss. \u201cIt\u2019s communication that embraces and uses the personal stories of those involved, that comes from listening, awareness, clarity and connection on all sides. Improving how we speak and listen to each other benefits everyone.\u201dThe Center for Empathy and Compassion Training in Medical Education, directed by Lisa Eyler, a professor in the UC San Diego School of Medicine Department of Psychiatry, seeks to develop, evaluate and disseminate educational programs to enhance empathy and compassion throughout medical training.\t\u00a0\tDr. Christopher R. Cannavino\t\u201cWe want to create a \u2018doctor\u2019s bag\u2019 of strategies to express and maintain compassion towards others and wellness-boosting skills to promote resilience and a humanistic approach in medical students that will remain throughout their careers,\u201d said Eyler.The Center for Empathy and Technology is directed by Cinnamon S. Bloss, an associate professor in the Herbert Wertheim School of Public Health and Human Longevity Science. Her center looks at how emerging biomedical and information technologies promote or undermine empathy, compassion and well-being for both provider and patient.\t\u201cWe want to be a leader at the intersection of empathy and technological innovation, supporting research and developing education programs that provide guidance for the empathic practice of medicine with new technologies,\u201d Bloss said.The Center for Mentorship in Medicine: Master Clinician Program, headed by Dr. Christopher R. Cannavino, associate professor of clinical pediatrics and director of the Pediatric Medical Student Education program in the UC San Diego School of Medicine, is dedicated to creating novel education programs that improve clinical training.\t\u201cThere is a science and art to practicing medicine,\u201d said Cannavino. \u201cWe want to train future physicians by connecting them with mentors\u2014experienced master clinicians\u2014who can model empathetic, compassionate care.\u201dThe Center for Research on Empathy and Compassion, headed Douglas Nitz, a professor and chair of the Department of Cognitive Science at UC San Diego, funds both basic and applied research exploring the neural underpinnings of empathy and compassion and how these discoveries can be applied to changing behaviors in health care training and practice.Douglas NitzThe center has already provided a number of seed grants for projects ranging from using imaging to trace empathy to distinct regions of the brain and the effect of compassion meditation on brain function to meditation practices to reduce physician burnout and in families with child mental illness and helping doctors compassionately discuss chronic pain with patients.\u201cIt will take all of us, working together, to achieve success,\u201d said Patrick. \u201cWe intend to participate in no less than a transformation of the world into a just and healthy place for all members of society.\u201dShareFacebookTwitterLinkedinRedditEmailPrintKeep up with campus news by subscribing to This\u00a0Week\u00a0@\u00a0UC\u00a0San\u00a0Diego Filed UnderDiversity & InclusionMore This WeekSubscribe to This WeekPrevious IssuesAbout Our CampusCampus ProfileCampus ToursContact UCPAHomeNewsAll NewsReturn to Learn ProgramCOVID-19Arts & CultureAthleticsBusiness & EconomicsCampus & CommunityDiversity & InclusionHealth & MedicinePhilanthropyResearchScience & EngineeringSociety & PoliticsSlideshowsThis Week NewsmagazineCurrent IssuePast IssuesAbout This WeekSubscribeResources for MediaFaculty ExpertsMedia ContactsCampus ProfileCampus ImagesStudio Ten 300LogoUniversity NameSearchThis SiteSearch NewsSearch UC San DiegoSearch Faculty/StaffcloseSearch NewsSearchSearchSearch UC San DiegoSearchSearchSearch Faculty and StaffSearchSearchcloseFacebookTwitterYouTubeInstagramImportant informationEmergency StatusDisability ResourcesPrinciples of CommunityEquity, Diversity and InclusionUC San Diego9500 Gilman Dr., La Jolla, CA 92093 \t\t\t\t858 534-2230Copyright \u00a9 2021\t\t\t\tRegents of the University of California. \t\t\t\tAll rights reserved.TermsAccessibilityContactDivisions and SchoolsArts & HumanitiesBiological SciencesJacobs School of EngineeringPhysical SciencesRady School of ManagementSchool of Global Policy and StrategySchool of MedicineScripps Institution of OceanographySkaggs School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical SciencesSocial SciencesThe Herbert Wertheim School of Public Health and Human Longevity ScienceOther University SitesAdmissionsAlumniAthleticsChancellorDiversityExtensionGivingHealth SystemLibraryMapsPreuss School"}, {"id": 151, "url": "https://ucsdnews.ucsd.edu/feature/summer-steam-workshops-from-sally-ride-science-junior-academy-reach-beyond-state-national-borders/", "html": "NEWSUC San DiegoUC San Diego News CenterMENUThis Week @ UC San DiegoBy Margaret KingJun 03, 2021SubscribeThe Junior Academy began as an in-person summer program before going online due to the pandemic. Photo courtesy UC San Diego Extension.Summer STEAM Workshops from Sally Ride Science Junior Academy Reach Beyond State, National BordersDuring this summer\u2019s Sally Ride Science Junior Academy, students in grades 3-12 will have a chance to expand their horizons in more ways than one. As they embark on virtual voyages to distant planets, icy polar regions and the deepest ocean, they will be accompanied by classmates from across the country and around the world.The Junior Academy began with in-person summer workshops in 2016, soon after Sally Ride Science became part of UC San Diego. When the pandemic forced classes online last summer, the remote format allowed the program to expand its reach well beyond San Diego. The 2020 academy enrolled students from 22 states and several countries.Lal Sezgin of Istanbul is a member of the Turkish national swimming team. She has enrolled in a Junior Academy programming workshop. Photo courtesy Lal Sezgin.This summer\u2019s Junior Academy, again conducted via Zoom, has drawn increasing international interest, with students already enrolling from Canada, India, Mexico, Switzerland and Turkey. The trend is in keeping with the university\u2019s commitment to global learning, said Morgan Appel, assistant dean for Education and Community Outreach ECO at UC San Diego Extension, which oversees Sally Ride Science programs.\u201cAs is the case with the University of California more broadly, ECO has at its core a mission that interweaves research, teaching and service in the name of public good,\u201d Appel said. \u201cWe believe that education is a fundamental human right, whether you are in La Jolla, London or Liberia.\u201dThe 2021 Junior Academy comes as Sally Ride Science marks its 20th anniversary. America\u2019s first woman in space had retired from NASA and was teaching physics at UC San Diego when she cofounded Sally Ride Science in 2001. Her goal was to inspire all students, especially girls, in STEM science, technology, engineering and math.The academy, from July 12 to Aug. 6, offers dozens of weeklong STEAM STEM plus arts workshops for elementary, middle school and high school students. Topics range from oceanography and space science to coding and 3D modeling. Scholarships are available to cover the cost of one workshop per student.Long-distance learningAmong this summer\u2019s international students is Yash Negi, an 11th grader in Ghaziabad, India. In a Zoom call, Yash talked about how he decided to enroll in the Junior Academy. \u201cI have a very deep interest in astronomy and everything regarding space,\u201d he said, \u201cso I searched for science programs, and I got to know about the Sally Ride Science program.\u201dHe chose a workshop on Astrobiology, in which students will survey organisms in extreme environments on Earth and consider the possibility of life on other worlds. \u201cThe idea of life on other planets has been a big thought for me ever since my childhood,\u201d Yash explained. \u201cI wanted to know more about that. And also, in the future, I aim to start a venture for interplanetary research to discover if life could exist there.\u201dYash Negi, who lives in Ghaziabad, India, is taking a workshop on Astrobiology through this summer\u2019s Sally Ride Science Junior Academy. Photo courtesy Yash Negi.Yash, who hopes to study astrophysics at an American university, looks forward to interacting with students from the U.S. and possibly other countries who share his fascination with space. \u201cSince they are like-minded students, we can exchange information and gain more knowledge,\u201d he said.Lal Sezgin, a 10th grader in Istanbul, Turkey, enrolled in C++ Programming, a new offering this year. \u201cI want to major in computer science, and I chose the Sally Ride program because there are a lot of opportunities in science and computers,\u201d she said via Zoom.Lal, a competitive swimmer who is on the Turkish national swimming team, expects to attend college on an athletic scholarship, and she is looking toward U.S. universities, including UC San Diego. She is eager to return to California after visiting when her sister was doing an exchange program in San Francisco. \u201cI loved it ,\u201d she said. \u201cThe people were so different from here in Turkey, and the places we went were great.\u201dBecause of the 10-hour time difference, Lal will be signing on to Junior Academy Zoom sessions in the evening, but she doesn\u2019t think that will be a problem. \u201cActually, I mostly study at night\u2014that works better for me,\u201d she said.Liliana Salcido, an 11th-grader in Escobedo, Mexico, near Monterrey, signed up for another new workshop, Polar Microbes, which explores the role of microorganisms in Arctic and Antarctic ecosystems. \u201cIt caught my eye because it is a very uncommon topic for me, even though I\u2019m a STEM enthusiast,\u201d she said.Liliana wants to study engineering in Monterrey and then do graduate work in the United States. She hopes the Junior Academy will give her a chance to learn more about UC San Diego. \u201cOne of my goals is to be able to study for a graduate degree in the department of nanoengineering or biotechnology at UC San Diego,\u201d she said.Exchanging ideasThe involvement of students from different regions and countries enriches the Junior Academy experience for local students, said Megan Lancaster, Extension\u2019s program manager for Sally Ride Science.\u201cBy participating in courses with students from all over the world, Junior Academy students are exposed to different cultures and languages, new ideas and various methods of approaching problems,\u201d she said. \u201cThey also can build relationships with those they may not have had the chance to connect with.\u201dThe 2021 academy combines popular returning workshops\u2014such as Messy Discoveries, Tiny Houses and Marine Biodiversity\u2014with engaging new topics, including:Adventures Under the Sea: Middle school students will examine relationships among living things in ocean ecosystems, including food webs and predator-prey relationships.Website Design: Elementary students will discover how to use HTML and CSS to design effective websites. The workshop is also offered in Mandarin Chinese.Deep-Space Base Building: Students will survey conditions on different planets and then design a base to sustain astronauts on another world. The workshop is offered for elementary or high school students.This year\u2019s academy also includes expanded offerings in the arts, including a boot camp called \u201cLights, Camera, Acting!\u201d Students will get a broad overview of different types of acting, from TV and film to musical theater and even Shakespeare.This summer, students will receive 1.5 pre-college credits for each workshop for the first time. Lancaster said the credits can be used in several ways. \u201cStudents can potentially apply these credits to their year-round school transcripts, transfer the credits to a post-secondary institution or include them on resumes,\u201d she said.ShareFacebookTwitterLinkedinRedditEmailPrintKeep up with campus news by subscribing to This\u00a0Week\u00a0@\u00a0UC\u00a0San\u00a0Diego More This WeekSubscribe to This WeekPrevious IssuesAbout Our CampusCampus ProfileCampus ToursContact UCPAHomeNewsAll NewsReturn to Learn ProgramCOVID-19Arts & CultureAthleticsBusiness & EconomicsCampus & CommunityDiversity & InclusionHealth & MedicinePhilanthropyResearchScience & EngineeringSociety & PoliticsSlideshowsThis Week NewsmagazineCurrent IssuePast IssuesAbout This WeekSubscribeResources for MediaFaculty ExpertsMedia ContactsCampus ProfileCampus ImagesStudio Ten 300LogoUniversity NameSearchThis SiteSearch NewsSearch UC San DiegoSearch Faculty/StaffcloseSearch NewsSearchSearchSearch UC San DiegoSearchSearchSearch Faculty and StaffSearchSearchcloseFacebookTwitterYouTubeInstagramImportant informationEmergency StatusDisability ResourcesPrinciples of CommunityEquity, Diversity and InclusionUC San Diego9500 Gilman Dr., La Jolla, CA 92093 \t\t\t\t858 534-2230Copyright \u00a9 2021\t\t\t\tRegents of the University of California. \t\t\t\tAll rights reserved.TermsAccessibilityContactDivisions and SchoolsArts & HumanitiesBiological SciencesJacobs School of EngineeringPhysical SciencesRady School of ManagementSchool of Global Policy and StrategySchool of MedicineScripps Institution of OceanographySkaggs School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical SciencesSocial SciencesThe Herbert Wertheim School of Public Health and Human Longevity ScienceOther University SitesAdmissionsAlumniAthleticsChancellorDiversityExtensionGivingHealth SystemLibraryMapsPreuss School"}, {"id": 152, "url": "https://campaign.ucsd.edu/impact/coronavirus/?_ga=2.254446472.1861795599.1586886647-989071472.1586886647/", "html": "Information for: Faculty and StaffParents and FamiliesStudents MenuMENUMENUGiving OpportunitiesStudent Support and SuccessStudent Support and SuccessOur Campus and CommunityOur Campus and CommunityHealth and MedicineHealth and MedicineResearch and InnovationResearch and InnovationImpact StoriesLearn MoreAbout the CampaignWays to GiveWays to GiveFrequently Asked QuestionsContact UsGET INVOLVEDAttend an EventAttend an EventVolunteerVolunteerGet SocialFollow us on following social media and share the incredible stories of our students and innovators.\r GIVE NOWCloseHome / Impact / Join Us in the Fight Against COVID-19 \u2014 and Help Those Affected by It Join Us in the Fight Against COVID-19 \u2014 and Help Those Affected by ItUC SAN DIEGO\u2019S COVID-19 RESPONSEAlthough the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted nearly every facet of our lives, our ongoing vaccine rollout offers hope for the end of the pandemic.

For these candidates, we will base secondary application decisions on the information that is available to us at the time of the application.\u00a0\u00a0For all applicants, we will make decisions regarding interviews without consideration of the MCAT score.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0We have a strong preference for\u00a0applicants to have taken the MCAT before we make final, post-interview\u00a0admissions decisions for the entering class of 2022.\u00a0 \u00a0We may decide to consider an applicant for an admission decision without an MCAT, on a case-by-case basis, if they were prevented from taking it due to an insurmountable barrier or extenuating circumstance despite a good-faith effort, exclusively per our determination. We will vet applicants in this position for an admissions decision without an MCAT only after they have completed an interview, and not beforehand.\u00a0\u00a0If an applicant was able to sit for an MCAT exam but\u00a0feels their MCAT performance or ability to take the MCAT was significantly adversely affected by a pandemic-related issue, we will allow a short statement describing that hardship or adversity to be appended to their secondary application.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 All applicants to UC San Diego School of Medicine must submit an AMCAS application during the official application time period of May 27, 2021\u00a0to October 15, 2021. Applicants may begin working on their application as early as May 3, 2021, but will not be able to submit until May 27. \rDeadline extensions cannot be granted for submission of this application.- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -Policy regarding Pass/No Pass and On-Line coursework due to\u00a0COVID-19 impactThe UCSD School of Medicine will accept grades of Pass/No Pass for all coursework for Winter 2020, Spring 2020, the entire 2020\u00a0 - 2021 academic year, and Summer 2021\u00a0 \u00a0We have always accepted grades from online courses and will continue to do so.\u00a0\u00a0Explanation of \"rolling\" admissionsWe are aware that the perception of many applicants is that if you dont apply very early in the cycle, you are hurting your chances for admission.\u00a0 \u00a0This is not true and in fact has never been true for UCSD.\u00a0 \u00a0We do have \"rolling\" admissions.\u00a0\u00a0 But, what rolling admissions means from our perspective is that we plan to make a small number of offers spread throughout the year...it does NOT mean that we make all of our offers in October and November and reject any applicants that happen to be reviewed later.\u00a0 \u00a0It is very much in\u00a0our interest to try to form the best possible incoming class, and thus we do not make any decisions based on how early or how late we receive or review an application.\u00a0\u00a0 We leave plenty of room for strong applicants that apply later in the cycle.- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\u00a0Applicants will be notified by email if approved for a secondary application. Do not send any letters of recommendation directly to the Admissions Office. UC\u00a0San\u00a0Diego\u00a0will be participating in the AMCAS Letters Service for the 2021\u00a0- 2022\u00a0Application Year. Please visit the \rAAMC for more details about this service.A minimum of three letters are required from individuals who can provide a well considered evaluation of your qualifications for the medical profession. We will also accept a single \"Committee Letter\" compiled by your undergraduate schools pre-med advising office in lieu of the three letter minimum. We accept a maximum of five letters for the MD program, and a maximum of seven letters for the MD/PhD program.\u00a0 \u00a0If you are applying to the MD/PhD program, please note that a minimum of two letters should be from research-related facultyLetters from faculty at your four-year undergraduate institution are encouraged but not required. Letters can come from any source, including but not limited to: course instructors, research mentors, clinical faculty, work supervisors, non-faculty practicing physicians.All communication is through e-mail. Please add the UC San Diego\u00a0domain ucsd.edu to your safe list and make sure you regularly check your junk mail as the secondary application is time-sensitive.UC San Diego School of Medicine does not accept students in transfer from other medical schools.View a\u00a0Statistical Profile of the 2019\u00a0Entering ClassBootstrap Image OneUC San Diego School of MedicineAboutSchool AdministrationJobsGivingDepartmentsResearchEducationMaps & ParkingUC San Diego HealthFind a ProviderClinical TrialsPatient CareLocations\u00a0\r                                    \u00a0\r                                    \u00a0\r                                    \u00a0\r                                    \r                                            \u00a0\r                                             Official Web Site of the University of California, San Diego.\r                                            \u00a0\r                                            Regents of the University of California.

Our ultimate goal is to diversify the next generation of STEM leaders and empower them to achieve their academic and professional aspirations. We aim to change the face of science and technology.\u201d\u2014 Chancellor Carol T. ChristFor venture capitalist and social policy researcher Freada Kapor Klein\u00a0\u201974, wasting human potential is profoundly illogical. A recent $5\u00a0million gift to support diversity in STEM at Berkeley builds on her decades-long commitment to ensuring equal access to opportunity by leveraging the power of science and math.\u201cAt a time when every mom and pop shop has to have some kind of tech capability\u00a0\u2014 and tech is such a creative space\u00a0\u2014 we want it to look like America,\u201d says Kapor Klein, whose deep experience in addressing equity issues includes co-founding, in 1976, the first organization in the United States to focus on preventing sexual harassment in the workplace.At UC Berkeley nearly 20\u00a0years ago, Kapor Klein and her husband, Lotus founder Mitch Kapor, created SMASH the Summer Math and Science Honors academy\u00a0\u2014 a program for high school students that has since been replicated at 10\u00a0university sites across the country. The Kapors\u2019 recent gift builds upon the program\u2019s success by providing scholarships for SMASH alumni to attend Berkeley and participate in SEED Stem Equity and Excellence in Diversity Scholars, an honors program focused on supporting and inspiring historically marginalized populations majoring in all areas of STEM. Like SMASH, SEED Scholars provides opportunities to explore the social justice aspects of pursuing a career in STEM. At events such as\u00a0\u201cScience, Society, and You\u201d\u00a0\u2014 a series of conversations facilitated by graduate students\u00a0\u2014 SEED Scholars participants confront the complexities of prejudice in STEM fields.Freada Kapor Klein\u00a0\u201974\u00a0and Mitch Kapor\u201cHaving conversations at the nexus of science and social justice empowers our students, regardless of their background, to feel comfortable bringing up issues that are either not spoken of in STEM circles, or are spoken of only in whispers,\u201d says Ira Young, director of SEED Scholars.\u00a0\u201cThey learn how to be bold in that area, in bringing about change. Our students develop a voice and excel in science at the same time.\u201dTopics such as how it feels to be othered, how to conduct yourself when you\u2019re an\u00a0\u201conly\u201d in a lab, and the myth of the model minority are discussed as part of SEED Scholars\u2019 holistic support, which lays the groundwork for what Young defines as a lifelong relationship with a community of groundbreaking peers.For the Kapors, providing scholarships and programmatic support for SEED Scholars was a logical extension of their work with SMASH. By making SMASH students aware of the scholarship to attend the SEED Scholars program at Berkeley, Kapor Klein is directly contributing to the diversification of STEM at her alma mater\u00a0\u2014 and eventually the tech sector. Further, the gift made sense in the context of Kapor Capital, the Kapors\u2019 socially-conscious venture capital firm.\u201cAt Kapor Capital we get pitched every week by entrepreneurs\u00a0\u2014 and a lot of entrepreneurs of color\u00a0\u2014 who are coming up with ways to leverage tech to solve real problems in their communities,\u201d says Kapor Klein.\u00a0\u201cWhat SMASH tries to do is to not just teach computer science and other STEM fields, but to expose our scholars to all the different ways they can leverage a STEM education in their future careers.\u201dFreada Kapor Klein \u201974\u00a0and Haile Shavers \u201918For SMASH alumna Haile Shavers\u00a0\u201918, the program and her relationship with the Kapors made a critical difference in her experience pursuing her cognitive science degree at Berkeley and launching her career as a developer at the business messaging company Slack.\u201cI wouldn\u2019t have felt as comfortable as I did, coming into a big university, and also wouldn\u2019t have had as many connections as I do in terms of academia and industry,\u201d says Shavers, reflecting on what life would have been like without SMASH.\u00a0\u201cWhen SMASH ends, that\u2019s not the end of the relationship that we have with SMASH and Mitch and Freada. She\u2019s a big advocate of me wanting to grow as a Black woman, as an engineer, as an overall human.\u201dWhile the gift provides scholarships specifically for SMASH alumni, all SEED Scholars students will be invited to participate in events at the Kapor Center in Oakland. The Kapors and SEED leaders are enthusiastic about the many possibilities for creating connections among rising and more established leaders in STEM and business.\u201cThis gift signals a great opportunity for SEED students and the program as a whole to tap into the substantial Kapor network,\u201d says Jamie Cate, faculty director of SEED Scholars.Kapor Klein has always relied on data to inform her social justice work. Completing her Ph.D. in social policy research required that she process information about 20,000\u00a0research subjects, which in the 1980s meant learning to run a program that could deal with a massive amount of data stored on tapes. She has a deep appreciation for the power of technology to serve progressive values, and she brought that understanding to her work at Lotus, the flagship computer company founded by her husband and business partner. At the time, her goal was to make Lotus the most progressive employer in the United States.The Kapors\u2019 recent gift to Berkeley reflects their visionary approach to social change that is also pragmatic and data-informed. Their investment includes support for SEED Scholars to build its capacity for programmatic evaluation, something they are deeply committed to with SMASH. Kapor Klein credits her days as a Berkeley undergraduate with exciting her passion for rigorous and actionable research. Clearly, the Kapors are dedicated to the healthy evolution of the initiatives they support and to the success of the many lives they touch.\u201cWhen the project connects with the students\u2019 lived experience, with what they see and what they can do, they feel empowered to make a difference while having a great career. That is so motivating and just life changing,\u201d says Mitch Kapor.\u00a0\u201cWe\u2019ve seen that so many times. Extending that from SMASH academy into the undergraduate experience through the SMASH-SEED connection is just a logical extension of what we\u2019ve been doing for decades.\u201dStory by Elizabeth CostelloRelated storiesLight the Way: Video highlights from an unforgettable opening                                Read Story \u00bb Light the Way: Video highlights from an unforgettable opening                            Chancellor Christ on Cal\u2019s response to COVID-19                                Read Story \u00bb Chancellor Christ on Cals response to COVID-19                            Berkeley Student Farms grows more than food                                Read Story \u00bb Berkeley Student Farms grows more than food                            Vision 2028: Charting a course forward                                Read Story \u00bb Vision 2028: Charting a course forward                            Peruse issues of our donor magazine, The Promise of BerkeleyUniversity of California, BerkeleySocial Media Menu            Copyright \u00a9 2020 UC Regents.

Of the $30,440,627 allocated to UC Berkeley as part of the CARES Act, $15,220,313 was awarded to the institution and this portion was used to support the housing refunds to students who had to vacate their housing under COVID-19 restrictions.Student portion   To support our students\u2019 financial well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic, the University of California Berkeley is providing emergency financial aid grants to eligible undergraduate and graduate students from the Higher Education Emergency Relief Fund, part of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security CARES Act.   On April 10, 2020, the University of California Berkeley signed and returned to the Department of Education the Certification and Agreement for Higher Education Emergency Relief Funding and intends to use no less than 50 percent of the funds received under \u00a7 18004a1 of the CARES Act to provide Emergency Financial Aid Grants to students.  The university has received $15,220,314 from the Department pursuant to the institution\u2019s Certification and Agreement for Emergency Financial Aid Grants to Students.  The total amount of Emergency Financial Aid Grants distributed to students under \u00a7 18004a1 of the CARES Act, the total number of students who have received an Emergency Financial Aid Grant to Students under \u00a7 18004a1 of the CARES Act, and the estimated total number of students eligible to participate in programs under \u00a7 484 in Title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965 and thus eligible to receive Emergency Financial Aid Grants to Students under \u00a7 18004a1 of the CARES Act are available on Financial Aid and Scholarships\u2019 COVID-19 CARES Act Emergency Financial Aid Grants page.  The Financial Aid and Scholarships Office team collaborated with campus partners, including the Division of Equity and Inclusion, the Graduate Division, student government leaders, and the Student Advocate\u2019s Office, to award and distribute these funds. Payments were sent out to students on Thursday, May 7. The IRS website FAQs provide guidance related to exclusion of these payments as gross income for tax reporting purposes, as they are considered qualified disaster relief payments under section 139 of the Internal Revenue Code. Likewise, expenses paid with this funding cannot be claimed as deductions. More information is available on the Financial Aid and Scholarship Office website.  The university used the following methods to determine which students receive Emergency Financial Aid Grants and how much they receive under \u00a7 18004a1 of the CARES Act.Undergraduate students  Undergraduate students at the institution eligible to participate in programs under \u00a7 484 in the Title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965 Students, who were actively enrolled as of May 1, 2020, with financial need greater than $500 based on the 2019-20 aid application, who had not already received emergency funding or a cash housing refund greater than $1,000 were awarded funding to cover expenses related to the disruption of campus operations due to the COVID-19 crisis. The grant amounts each undergraduate student received are based on Expected Family Contribution EFC as reflected on the 2019\u201320 aid application.    EFCGrant Amount   $0$1,300 $1-$2,500$1,200 $2,501-$5,000$1,100 $5,001-$7,500$950 $7,501-$10,000$750 >$10,000$500 Graduate students  Graduate students at the institution eligible to participate in programs under \u00a7 484 in the Title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965 Students, who were actively enrolled as of May 15, 2020, with financial need greater than $1,000 based on the 2019-20 or 2020-21 aid application, who had not already received emergency funding or a cash housing refund greater than $1,000 were awarded funding to cover expenses related to the disruption of campus operations due to the COVID-19 crisis. Graduate student awards are $1,000.  Students receiving these funds are sent this CARES Act funding email notification. Additional funding: May be awarded on a case-by-case basis to undergraduate and graduate students who have submitted a Cost of Attendance Adjustment Request for additional expenses that have resulted from the COVID-19 emergency and the move to remote instruction.Institutional portion  Of the $30,440,627 allocated to UC Berkeley as part of the CARES Act, $15,220,313 was awarded to the institution to defray operational expenses related to the impact of COVID-19.

Torres            Vice Chancellor                Research and Economic Development      May 29, 2020Dear Colleagues,I am pleased to announce that we have finalized requirements for ramping up on-campus research as part of our next phase of returning to our physical workspaces. I appreciate the feedback we received after I mentioned this effort in the recent RED newsletter and believe our plan will provide an important framework to ensure adherence to public health guidelines designed to protect our students, faculty, and staff.The final document is available here. There is also a Research Ramp-Up Agreement form that must be executed by each principal investigator and approved by their corresponding dean before research resumes. The procedures have been reviewed and endorsed by the Operations/Support Recovery and Public Health Committees that were formed to align all campus activities with CDC and public health recommendations focused on health and safety. I am grateful for their most valuable contributions to this document.\u00a0The official start of Phase 2 of our ramp-up plan is June 8, 2020. This may give some PIs who are already performing some minimal functions time to adapt to the new conditions and get dean\u2019s approval if a ramp-up in activities needs to take place. However, we expect it may take longer than that for many others to get their labs/facilities/team ready to ramp-up. To emphasize, June 8 is the earliest date research ramp-up can occur if everything needed is in place; it is not the date by which everybody authorized to resume on-campus activities must be onsite.\u00a0I would also like to thank again the Research Ramp-up Committee members who developed our framework:Shaun Bowler, Graduate Division DeanDjurdjica Coss, Academic Senate Committee on Research ChairDerick Fay, IRB-SB ChairSheila Hedayati, Environmental Health and Safety Executive Director*Marcus Kaul, School of Medicine RepresentativeChris Lynch, Bourns College of Engineering DeanPeggy Mauk, Agricultural Operations DirectorMilagros Pe\u00f1a, College of Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences DeanDylan Rodriguez, Academic Senate ChairThomas Smith, Interim Executive Vice Chancellor and ProvostJason Stajich, Academic Senate Chair-ElectDavid Volz, IACUC ChairAmeae Walker, Vice Provost for Academic PersonnelJohn Warren, UCR News and Information DirectorChristiane Weirauch, Academic Senate Vice Chair* Liaison with Operations/Support Recovery working groupAs I mentioned previously, plans to resume on-campus research have been coordinated across the UC system, and our working group adapted the broader approach to suit our campus needs.\u00a0Please contact your dean or me if you have questions about the protocols for resuming on-campus research.Related AnnouncementsCampus labs conducting human subjects research may resume operationsMay 26, 2021Read More \u00bbLabs may increase density up to 50% maximum occupancyApril 13, 2021Read More \u00bbFederal Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act NAGPRA awareness raisingApril 6, 2021Read More \u00bbUndergraduate researchers back to campusMarch 29, 2021Read More \u00bbSearchUniversity of California, Riverside900 University Ave.            Riverside, CA 92521Tel: 951 827-1012UCR LibraryCampus StatusCampus StoreCareer OpportunitiesDiversityMaps and DirectionsVisit UCRUniversity of California, Riverside             900 University Ave.            Riverside, CA 92521                          tel: 951 827-0000                        email: webmaster@ucr.edu  Find UsFollow US:Related LinksUCR NewsResearch BlogInside UCR ArchiveHuman ResourcesUC Path PortalStaff AssemblyUC NewsroomPrivacy PolicyTerms and Conditions\u00a9 2021 Regents of the University of CaliforniaSearch\u00d7Let us help you with your searchEnter your Search Criteria.Search All UCRSearch This SiteCancel"}, {"id": 227, "url": "https://insideucr.ucr.edu/announcements/2020/04/06/guidance-asymptomatic-site-ucr-personnel-non-healthcare-duties/", "html": "COVID-19\u00a0information, guidance, and resources.

Monitor yourself twice daily to track any signs of fever or symptoms cough, shortness of breath, difficulty breathing. When checking for fever, it is recommended to do so without the use of fever-reducing or other symptom-altering medicines e.g. cough suppressants.2. A self-monitoring form is provided on the following page for your convenience. Here are the symptoms you need to look out for:\u2022 Fever: temperature > 100.4\u00b0F 38.0\u00b0CPlease consult with your supervisor if you do not have access to a thermometer.\u2022 New cough\u2022 New shortness of breath\u2022 New difficulty breathing3. Adhere to hand hygiene, respiratory hygiene, and cough etiquette in CDC\u2019s interim infection control guidance e.g., wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, cover nose and mouth when coughing or sneezing, dispose of tissues in waste receptacles.What should I do if I develop COVID-19 symptoms?If symptoms appear, you should:\u2022 Stay home and call your supervisor to report symptoms.o UCR will keep this information confidential and limited to only those with a need-to-know to address the situation. This information will not be maintained in your personnel file.\u2022 If you seek medical treatment, contact the hospital or physician\u2019s office prior to going in.What are the campuss guidelines for face coverings?On April 4, 2020, Riverside County Health issued an order requiring that all people wear fabric face coverings to cover their nose and mouth in public places, both indoors and outdoors. The campus has ordered all-cotton bandanas for limited distribution to employees working on campus. These bandanas are not hospital-grade face coverings, but rather will help reduce exposure to droplets in the air that contain the COVID-19 virus.

How do I request something be digitized?You must create a free account in our Special Collections Request System.You can then submit a reproduction request and staff will be in contact with you to invoice for non-UCR affiliates, page count, digitize, and electronically deliver the item.

During the closure, we will scan up to 200 pages per month per UCR-affiliate for free. Anything above 200 pages will require a consultation with a librarian who can help focus the request. You can schedule a one-on-one consultation with a librarian by emailing sandy.enriquez@ucr.edu or specialcollections@ucr.edu.Non-UCR Affiliates will have to pay standard rates:\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0$1.00/page for jpg, pdf, or existing tiff. $25/page for new tiffs.\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Note: Priority for digital services is currently being given to UCR-affiliates and it may take longer for other requests to be filled.

You should also check the UCR Library catalog to see if the book is available there. If it is, you can request the book via curbside delivery.   How long will it take for me to receive my digital request?UCR-affiliates are currently given priority for digital requests and then requests from non-UCR affiliates will be filled.\u00a0Requests are handled in the order received and rush requests are not possible.\u00a0If the requested materials are of standard size, requests are usually filled within 5-7 business days but could take as long as two weeks.\u00a0If the requested materials are oversize, they must be scanned in the Orbach Science Library. This can add an additional 1-2 weeks to the processing of the order.   Before I submit a request, can you meet with me via Zoom and show me the items I may want digitized?Because of current staffing levels we cannot meet via Zoom to physically show you the item you may want digitized.

Some of our buildings are much older and have some limitations. Our buildings are designed to provide sufficientair changes based on building activities. We are making a special effort to ensure that all buildings have current filter changes. The information below is how HVAC systems are maintained.Expanded Timeframe: To help with airflow, Facilities Services is expanding the length of time outside airflow will circulate throughout each building.Filtration Maintenance: Building filtration systems are well maintained and have the appropriate level of filters for each building.Air Flow: To accommodate efficient airflow in each building, the most advanced level of filters are being used based on the building\u2019s air filtration system capabilities.Building VentilationStrict adherence to the public health posters and other visual cues throughout campus and in buildings will reduce transmission risks. Ventilation systems will continue to operate as designed even though building occupancy will be reduced. This will further reduce the risk of potential airborne transmission.\u00a0 While each individual occupant of a campus building will want to make sure these guidelines are followed, including limited occupancy, it will be very important to ensure that all the other occupants in that building, at least on that same floor, coordinate to ensure the overall density and guidelines are being followed on a collective basis.Transmission Reduction EffortsAccording to the World Health Organization WHO and the Centers for Disease Control CDC, the COVID-19 virus appears to spread human-to-human through respiratory droplets coming from an infected person. Based on public health guidance, the key transmission reduction factors include:social distancing,limiting occupancy,practicing good personal hygiene, andutilizing face coveringsAs part of the public health guidance, Facilities Services will disinfect high-touch areas including elevators, door handles, common areas and restrooms. We have made disinfecting kits available to departments and hand sanitizing stations are located at the entrance of each building. A map locating sanitizing stations can be viewed by clicking\u00a0here.\u00a0HVAC VENTILATION FAQSStandard Operating Procedures SOPGeneral Areas: Office Space\tGeneral Area/Office Space Disinfection SOPLaboratories\tLaboratory/Research Space Disinfection SOPFacilities\tdisinfection response plan SOPResourcesTraining |\u00a0COVID-19 Prevention TrainingWellness Check |\u00a0COVID-19 Wellness Check Survey\u00a0Hotline\u00a0|\u00a0Report suspect or confirmed cases:\u00a0UCR Employee COVID Hotline: 844 827-6827Concerns |\u00a0\u00a0Report a COVID-19 or Public Health Concern to EH&SFace covering |\u00a0Request a Face CoveringHuman Resources |\u00a0Benefits/Leave InformationKeep Researching | Announcements and\u00a0guidance\u00a0Office of Research Integrity | Institutional Review BoardsResearch Ramp-Up |\u00a0\u00a0Research Ramp-Up WorkgroupTeaching |\u00a0\u00a0Instructional Continuity PlanTesting |\u00a0COVID-19 Testing SitesTravel |\u00a0UC & UCR Travel InformationSignage\u00a0and posting ResourcesVisitors |\u00a0UCR Affiliate Guide for Visitors, Contractors, Vendors and non UCR personnel that needs to come to campus.\u00a0Frequently Asked QuestionsQuick LinksCampus ReturnHotlineUCR Daily Wellness Check SurveyHuman Resources COVID-19 ResourcesStudent Health ServicesCampus Emergency StatusKeep TeachingKeep LearningKeep WorkingKeep ResearchingCoronavirus ResourcesFace Covering RequestResearch Ramp UpResearch Operations            What is the status of research operations at UCR?

This is consistent with the UC President Napolitano\u2019s\u00a0directive\u00a0to avoid all non-essential travel to CDC Level 3 and 2 countries.Other things to keep in mind when considering international travel:If you are traveling for university-related business, please consider whether you can participate remotely e.g., via online platforms or teleconference or delay travel to a later date.If you decide to travel outside of the United States, please be aware that the CDC may issue new international travel warnings without notice, potentially resulting in limited or delayed flights and possible quarantine upon re-entry. \u00a0For personal travel, faculty, staff, and students are encouraged to register with\u00a0UC Away. \u00a0Please ensure that your family and friends are aware of your travel plans and how to reach you.Prevention & Treatment            What is SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19?    Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses of which some members may cause mild upper respiratory infections. Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 SARS-CoV-2, previously known as 2019-nCoV, is the virus responsible for the outbreak of acute respiratory illnesses in Wuhan, China beginning December 2019. The WHO has named the acute respiratory illness caused by this virus as COVID-19.Much is unknown about SARS-CoV-2 and current knowledge is based largely on what is known about similar coronaviruses. Experts believe that symptom onset will most likely occur between 2 and 14 days of infection. Community-based transmission has now been observed in multiple countries. Most often spread from person-to-person happens among close contact 6 feet or closer.Typically, with most respiratory viruses, people are thought to be most contagious when they are symptomatic, however the possibility of asymptomatic transmission has not been ruled out.            What can I protect myself from COVID-19?    There are several steps you can take to effectively help prevent becoming infected with COVID-19:\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Avoid close contact with people who are sick.\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Always practice good hand hygiene. Wash your hands with soap and water frequently for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water is not available, an alcohol-based gel sanitizer from 60-95% alcohol is an acceptable substitute.\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth.\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Cover your coughs and sneezes into a tissue and dispose of tissue in trash immediately.\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Clean and disinfect surfaces and objects that may be contaminated with germs.See more recommendations and guidance from CDCs COVID-19 Prevention and Wellness            What should I do if I feel ill?    If you are sick, stay home. If you have recently traveled within 14 days to a state, territory or country with widespread, ongoing transmission, or have traveled on a cruise ship or river boat,\u00a0or have been in direct contact for a prolonged period with someone known or suspected to have COVID-19, contact your healthcare provider right away and inform them of your symptoms and travel history. If you require medical attention, call ahead before leaving and inform them of a potential COVID-19 case. Always call ahead when possible.Schedule an appointment with Student Health Center\u00a0951-827-3031 or your primary care physician if you are an employee.While you are sick, follow CDC recommendations:Stay at home except to get medical careSeparate yourself from other people in your home and avoid sharing personal itemsWear a facemask when you are around other peopleCover your coughs and sneezes with a tissue. Dispose of the tissue immediately after use.Clean your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water is not available, using alcohol-based gel sanitizer with 60-95% alcohol is sufficient.Seek prompt medical attention if your illness is worsening call ahead of time and let the provider know of your concerns and current conditionsIf you are placed under active monitoring, or facilitated self-monitoring, follow the instructions provided by your physician, local health department, or occupational health professional.Consult with your health care provider before discontinuing home isolation.            Can I be tested for COVID-19?    Riverside County has dedicated testing locations\u00a0available by appointment. There is no cost or doctors orders required.\u00a0To find the location nearest to you:\u00a0https://www.rivcoph.org/coronavirus/testingIf you feel ill, please see the FAQ question \"What should\u00a0I do if I feel ill?\"            Should I use a face covering?    The university requires the use of face coverings in public. This follows recently revised Centers for Disease Control guidelines. The campus is providing non-hospital grade face coverings for limited distribution to employees working on campus, along with instructions for their use.            How should I report COVID-19 symptoms or a positive test?    One tool designed to protect the UCR Community and prevent the spread of COVID-19 is a hotline for employees for reporting COVID-19 symptoms or exposure.

What do I do regarding social distancing?    To prevent infection, we recommend adhering to the following social distancing practices:Vulnerable populations should limit outings and not attend large gatherings. Vulnerable populations are people 60 years of age and older; and people with health conditions such as heart disease, lung disease, diabetes, kidney disease, and weakened immune systems.If you are sick, stay home. Do not come to school or work, travel, or participate in large gatherings.If you have flu-like symptoms or suspect that you may have been exposed to COVID-19: Students should contact Student Health Services or their primary care physician. \u00a0Staff and faculty should their primary care physician, and UCR Health will be providing additional resources soon for all UCR employees.Important reminders regarding hygiene: 1 regularly wash your hands with soap and water or use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol, 2 cover your mouth with your elbow when you cough or sneeze, and 3 clean and disinfect surfaces often.For more information about social distancing and hygiene practices for the workplace and home, please visit the Centers for Disease Control CDC website.We understand that implementing these changes with such limited notice will have broad impacts and will be challenging and disruptive for many of you, and we appreciate your patience and cooperation.\u00a0            What do I do if I come into contact with a sick individual?    If the individual is a confirmed or suspected case of COVID-19, you should contact your primary care provider staff/faculty or Student Health Services students immediately and inform them of the potential contact. Stay at home and monitor your symptoms. If medical treatment is required, call ahead and explain your history and potential contact with a confirmed/suspected case of COVID-19. Follow CDC guidelines for preventing spreading COVID-19 to others.If the individual is not a confirmed or suspected case of COVID-19, you should follow standard precautions. Avoiding close contact with the individual, wash your hands often with soap and water, and monitor your symptoms.            Is the campus making masks available?    Supervisors may request a Face Covering for their team members max\u00a02 per person. Please\u00a0submit a request here.UCR is requiring the use of a face covering while in public or around others.

Most people with COVID-19 have mild symptoms, but some people can become severely ill. Although most people with COVID-19 get better within weeks of illness, some people experience post-COVID conditions. Post-COVID conditions\u00a0are a wide range of new, returning, or ongoing health problems people can experience\u00a0more than four weeks after first being infected with the virus that causes COVID-19. Older people and those who have certain underlying medical conditions\u00a0are more likely to get severely ill from COVID-19. Vaccines\u00a0against COVID-19 are safe and effective. Why is the disease being called coronavirus disease 2019, COVID-19?On February 11, 2020 the World Health Organization announced\u00a0an official name for the disease that is causing the 2019 novel coronavirus outbreak, first identified in Wuhan China. The new name of this disease is coronavirus disease 2019, abbreviated as COVID-19. In COVID-19, \u201cCO\u201d stands for corona, \u201cVI\u201d for virus, and \u201dD\u201d for disease. Formerly, this disease was referred to as \u201c2019 novel coronavirus\u201d or \u201c2019-nCoV.\u201d Top of PageSpreadHow does the virus spread?COVID-19 is thought to spread mainly through close contact from person to person, including between people who are physically near each other within about 6 feet. People who are infected but do not show symptoms can also spread the virus to others. Cases of reinfection with COVID-19 \u00a0have been reported but are rare. We are still learning about how the virus spreads and the severity of illness it causes.COVID-19 spreads very easily from person to person. How easily a virus spreads from person to person can vary. The virus that causes COVID-19 appears to spread more efficiently than influenza but not as efficiently as measles, which is among the most contagious viruses known to affect people.For more information about how COVID-19 spreads, visit the How COVID-19 Spreads\u00a0page to learn how COVID-19 spreads and how to protect yourself.\u00a0 What is community spread?Community spread means people have been infected with the virus in an area, including some who are not sure how or where they became infected. Each health department determines community spread differently based on local conditions. For information on community spread in your area, please visit your local health department\u2019s website. Can mosquitoes or ticks spread the virus that causes COVID-19?At this time, CDC has no data to suggest that this new coronavirus or other similar coronaviruses are spread by mosquitoes or ticks. The main way that COVID-19 spreads is from person to person. See How Coronavirus Spreads\u00a0for more information.

Does CDC recommend the use of masks to prevent COVID-19?Yes. CDC recommends that people wear masks in public settings, at events and gatherings, and anywhere they will be around other people. When you wear a mask, you protect others as well as yourself. Masks work best when everyone wears one. A mask is NOT a substitute for social distancing. Masks should still be worn in addition to staying at least 6 feet apart, especially when indoors around people who don\u2019t live in your household.Effective February 2, 2021, masks are required\u00a0on planes, buses, trains, and other forms of public transportation traveling into, within, or out of the United States and in U.S. transportation hubs such as airports and stations.While masks are strongly encouraged to reduce the spread of COVID-19, CDC recognizes there are specific instances when wearing a mask may not be feasible. In these instances, adaptations and alternatives\u00a0should be considered whenever possible.More information about masks can be found on our masks site.Your Guide to MasksHow to WearHow to Store and WashImprove How Your Mask Protects YouTypes of MasksGuidance for Wearing MasksImprove Fit and Filtration of Your Mask Is it safe to get care for my other medical conditions during this time?Continue taking care of your health and wellnessContinue your medications,\u00a0and do not change your treatment plan without talking to your healthcare provider.Continue to manage your disease\u00a0the way your healthcare provider has told you.Have at least a 2-week supply\u00a0of all prescription and non-prescription medications.Talk to your healthcare provider about whether your vaccinations and other preventative services are up to date.Call your healthcare providerif you have any concerns\u00a0about your medical conditions, or if you get sick.to find out about different ways you can connect with your healthcare provider for chronic disease management or other conditions.If you must visit in-person, protect yourself and others.Do not delay getting emergency care for your health problems or\u00a0any underlying medical\u00a0condition that requires immediate attention.If you need emergency help, call 911.Emergency departments have infection prevention plans to protect you from getting COVID-19 if you need care for your medical condition.Continue to practice everyday prevention. Wash your hands often, avoid close contact, wear a mask, cover coughs and sneezes, and clean frequently touched surfaces often.When picking up medicines, use drive-thru windows, curbside services prescriptions brought to you in your car, mail-order, or other delivery services.For more information, see Groups at Higher Risk for Severe Illness. Am I at risk for COVID-19 from mail, packages, or products?Coronaviruses are thought to be spread most often by respiratory droplets. Although the virus can survive for a short period on some surfaces, it is unlikely to be spread from domestic or international mail, products, or packaging. However, it may be possible that people can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.Learn more about safe handling of deliveries and mail.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Is it okay for me to donate blood?In healthcare settings across the United States, donated blood is a lifesaving, essential part of caring for patients. The need for donated blood is constant, and blood centers are open and in urgent need of donations. CDC encourages people who are well to continue to donate blood if they are able, even if they are practicing social distancing because of COVID-19. CDC is supporting blood centers by providing recommendations that will keep donors and staff safe. Examples of these recommendations include spacing donor chairs 6 feet apart, thoroughly adhering to environmental cleaning practices, and encouraging donors to make donation appointments ahead of time. Should contact lens wearers take special precautions to prevent COVID-19?Currently, there is no evidence to suggest contact lens wearers are more at risk for acquiring COVID-19 than eyeglass wearers.Contact lens wearers should continue to\u00a0practice safe contact lens wear and care hygiene habits\u00a0to help prevent against transmission of any contact lens-related infections, such as always washing hands with soap and water before handling lenses.People who are healthy can continue to wear and care for their contact lenses as prescribed by their eye care professional.Find more information about\u00a0how coronavirus spreads and how to protect yourself.Visit\u00a0CDC\u2019s contact lens website\u00a0for more information on healthy contact lens wear and care. Is contact lens disinfecting solution effective against COVID-19?Hydrogen peroxide-based systems\u00a0for cleaning, disinfecting, and storing contact lenses should be effective against the virus that causes COVID-19.For other disinfection methods, such as multipurpose solution and ultrasonic cleaners, there is currently not enough scientific evidence to determine efficacy against the virus.Always use solution\u00a0to disinfect your contact lenses and case to kill germs that may be present.Handle your lenses over a surface that has been cleaned and disinfected.Find more information about\u00a0how coronavirus spreads and how to protect yourself.Visit\u00a0CDC\u2019s contact lens website\u00a0for more information on healthy contact lens wear and care. Should I use soap and water or hand sanitizer to protect against COVID-19?Handwashing is one of the best ways to protect yourself and your family from getting sick. Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing; going to the bathroom; and before eating or preparing food. If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. What cleaning products should I use to protect against COVID-19?Clean frequently touched surfaces such as tables, doorknobs, light switches, countertops, handles, desks, phones, keyboards, toilets, faucets, and sinks. Cleaning with products containing soap or detergent reduces germs on surfaces and objects by removing contaminants and may weaken or damage some of the virus particles, which decreases risk of infection from surfaces. You may choose to also disinfect depending on\u00a0certain conditions\u00a0or everyday practices required by your home. To disinfect, most common Environmental Protection Agency-registered household disinfect ants will work. See CDC\u2019s recommendations for household cleaning and disinfection.

Most children with COVID-19 have mild symptoms or they may have no symptoms at all \u201casymptomatic\u201d. Fewer children have been sick with COVID-19 compared to adults. Babies younger than 1 and children with certain underlying medical conditions may be more likely to have serious illness from COVID-19. Some children have developed a rare but serious disease that is linked to COVID-19 called multisystem inflammatory syndrome MIS-C.For more information for parents or caregivers of children, see Children and Teens and the COVID-19 Parental Resources Kit.For more information about how people get sick with the virus that causes COVID-19, see How COVID-19 Spreads.\u00a0 Should children wear masks?In general, children 2 years and older should wear a mask. However, CDC recognizes that wearing masks may not be possible in every situation or for some people. Appropriate and consistent use of masks may be challenging for some children, such as children with certain disabilities, including cognitive, intellectual, developmental, sensory and behavioral disorders. Learn more about what you should do if your child or you cannot wear masks in certain situations and special considerations for children who may have difficulties with techniques for improved fit and filtration. What is multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children MIS-C?Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children MIS-C is a serious condition associated with COVID-19 where different body parts can become inflamed, including the heart, lungs, kidneys, brain, skin, eyes, or gastrointestinal organs. For information, see MIS-C. Can my child spend time with older adults and people with chronic medical conditions?Older adults and people who have certain underlying medical conditions\u00a0are at increased risk for getting severely ill from COVID-19. To protect those who are at increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19, you may consider taking these extra precautions.Separate your child from others in your household who have an increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19.Carefully consider who might be best to provide childcare if you are unable to care for your child for example, you are not able to stay with your child while childcare or school is closed.Limit your child\u2019s contact with other people if someone at higher risk for COVID-19 will be providing care such as an older adult or someone with an underlying medical condition.Postpone visits or trips to see grandparents, older family members and family members who are at increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19. Consider connecting virtually or by writing letters. My child has an underlying medical condition. What additional steps should my family take?Children with underlying medical conditions\u00a0are at increased risk for severe illness compared to children without underlying medical conditions. Current evidence on which underlying medical conditions in children are associated with increased risk is limited. Children with the following conditions might be at increased risk for severe illness: obesity, medical complexity, severe genetic disorders, severe neurologic disorders, inherited metabolic disorders, sickle cell disease, congenital since birth heart disease, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, asthma and other chronic lung disease, and immunosuppression due to malignancy or immune-weakening medications. In addition to following the recommendations to prevent getting sick, families can take steps recommended for children with underlying conditions.Consider identifying potential alternative caregivers, in case you or other regular caregivers become sick and are unable to care for your child. If possible, these alternative caregivers should not be at increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19. For more information, see Sick Parents and Caregivers. Make sure these caregivers take extra precautions if your child has a disability.If your child receives any support care services in the home, such as services from personal care attendants, direct support professionals, or therapists, make plans for what you will do if your child\u2019s direct care providers or anyone in your family gets sick. You can review CDC\u2019s recommendations for Direct Service Providers.For more information, see Children and Teens and Others who Need Extra Precautions. Should my infant or child be tested for COVID-19?Not everyone needs to be tested.

Is it possible to have the flu and COVID-19 at the same time?Yes. It is possible to test positive for flu as well as other respiratory infections and COVID-19 at the same time. Because some of the symptoms of flu and COVID-19 are similar, it may be hard to tell the difference between them based on symptoms alone. Testing may be needed to help confirm a diagnosis.The best way to prevent seasonal flu is to get vaccinated every year. Flu vaccines will not prevent COVID-19, but they will reduce your chances of getting flu. See Prevent Seasonal Flu\u00a0for more information.\u00a0 Top of PageTestingIs at-home specimen collection or testing available?Yes. At-home testing and collection allow you to collect a specimen at home and either send it to a testing facility or preform the test at home.You and your healthcare provider might consider either an at-home collection kit or an at-home test if you have signs and symptoms of COVID-19 or if you can\u2019t get testing at a local healthcare facility.For more information, see At-Home Testing. Should I be tested for a current infection?The following should be tested for current infection:People who have symptoms\u00a0of COVID-19.Most people who have had close contact\u00a0within 6 feet for a total of 15 minutes or more over a 24-hour period with someone with confirmed COVID-19.Fully vaccinated people with no COVID-19 symptoms do not need to be tested following an exposure to someone with COVID-19.People who have tested positive for COVID-19 within the past 3 months and recovered do not need to get tested following an exposure as long as they do not develop new symptoms.People who have taken part in activities that put them at higher risk for COVID-19 because they cannot physically distance as needed to avoid exposure such as travel, attending large social or mass gatherings, or being in crowded or poorly-ventilated indoor settings.People who have been asked or referred to get tested by their healthcare provider, or state, tribal, localexternal icon, or territorial health department.CDC recommends that anyone with any signs or symptoms of COVID-19\u00a0get tested, regardless of vaccination status or prior infection.\u00a0 If you get tested because you have symptoms or were potentially exposed to the virus, you should stay away from others pending test results and follow the advice of your health care provider or a public health professional. How can I get tested for a current infection viral test and what does my test mean?A viral test checks specimens from your nose or your mouth\u00a0 to find out if you are currently infected with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.Contact your healthcare provider or visit your state, tribal, localexternal icon, and territorial health department\u2019s website to find the latest local information on\u00a0testing. The type of viral COVID-19\u00a0tests offered\u00a0differ by location. You and your healthcare provider might also consider either an at-home collection kit\u00a0or an\u00a0at-home test if you have signs and symptoms of COVID-19 and if you are not able to be tested by a healthcare provider or public health official.While waiting for test results pdf icon[2 pages, 224KB], you should self-quarantine at home and stay away\u00a0from others, including those living in your household.

If you have symptoms of COVID-19 or you have been in close contact with someone with COVID-19 and are not tested, it is still important to stay home.\u00a0 For more information, visit What to Do if You Are Sick and When to Quarantine. How can I get tested for a past infection antibody test and what does my test mean?Antibody tests for COVID-19 are available through healthcare providers and laboratories. Check with your healthcare provider to see if they offer antibody tests and whether you should get one.A positive test result shows you might have antibodies from an infection with the virus that causes COVID-19. However, there is a chance a positive result means that you have antibodies from an infection with a virus from the same family of viruses called coronaviruses, such as the one that causes the common cold.Having antibodies to the virus that causes COVID-19 might provide some protection from getting infected with the virus again. If it does, we do not know how much protection the antibodies might provide or how long this protection might last. Confirmed and suspected cases of reinfection have been reported, but remain rare.You should continue to protect yourself and others\u00a0since you could get infected with the virus again.If you test negative, you might not have ever had COVID-19. Talk with your healthcare provider about your test result and the type of test you took to understand what your result means.Regardless of whether you test positive or negative, the results do not confirm whether or not you are able to spread the virus that causes COVID-19. Until we know more, continue to take steps to protect yourself and others.If you want more information about antibody tests, see Test for Past Infection. Can someone test negative and later test positive on a viral test for COVID-19?Yes, it is possible. You may test negative if the sample was collected early in your infection and test positive later during this illness. You could also be exposed to COVID-19 after the test and get infected then. Even if you test negative, you still should take steps to\u202fprotect yourself and others. See Testing for Current Infection for more information.

Are there any medications I should avoid taking if I have COVID-19?Currently, there is no evidence to suggest that taking any specific medications, like blood pressure medication or ibuprofen, leads to more severe illness from COVID-19.Continue to take your medications and to follow your treatment plan as prescribed by your healthcare provider. Any changes to your medications should only be made after talking with your healthcare provider.Contact your healthcare provider if you have questions or concerns.For more information, see People with Underlying Medical Conditions. Are people with disabilities at higher risk?Adults with disabilities are more likely to have an underlying medical condition\u00a0that may put them at increased risk of severe illness from COVID-19 including, but not limited to, heart disease, stroke, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, cancer, high blood pressure, and obesity. In addition, having a disability may make it harder to practice social distancing, wear a mask, and practice hand hygiene.For more information, see People with Disabilities and People who May Need Extra Precautions. Top of PagePeople with Seasonal AllergiesWhat is the difference between COVID-19 and seasonal allergies?COVID-19 is a contagious respiratory illness caused by infection with a new coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. Seasonal allergies triggered by airborne pollen can lead to seasonal allergic rhinitis, which affects the nose and sinuses, and seasonal allergic conjunctivitis, which affects the eyes.COVID-19 and seasonal allergies share many symptoms, but there are some key differences between the two. For example, COVID-19 can cause fever, which is not a common symptom of seasonal allergies. The image below compares symptoms caused by allergies and COVID-19.Because some of the symptoms of COVID-19 and seasonal allergies are similar, it may be difficult to tell the difference between them, and you may need to get a test to confirm your diagnosis508 version*Seasonal allergies do not usually cause shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, unless a person has a respiratory condition such as asthma that can be triggered by exposure to pollen.This is not a complete list of all possible symptoms of COVID-19 or seasonal allergies. Symptoms vary from person to person and range from mild to severe. You can have symptoms of both COVID-19 and seasonal allergies at the same time.If you think you have COVID-19, follow CDC\u2019s guidance on\u00a0\u201dWhat to do if you are sick.\u201d\u00a0If you have\u00a0an emergency warning sign\u00a0including trouble breathing, seek emergency medical care immediately.Get more information on\u00a0COVID-19 symptoms, or more information on seasonal allergy symptomsexternal icon. Does having seasonal allergies increase my risk of contracting COVID-19 or having more severe symptoms if I do contract COVID-19?There is not enough scientific information at this time to know whether having seasonal allergies puts you at higher risk of contracting COVID-19 or having more severe symptoms if you do contract COVID-19. We do know that older adults and people who have severe underlying medical conditions like obesity, diabetes, or heart or lung disease are at higher risk for developing more serious complications when they have COVID-19. Get more information on people at high risk for severe COVID-19. Will I be protected from seasonal allergies if I wear a mask?CDC recommends wearing\u00a0masks\u00a0to slow the spread of COVID-19. Everyone should wear a mask covering unless they are under 2 years of age, have breathing problems, or are unconscious or incapacitated and would need assistance removing a mask.\u00a0 Masks also offer some protection against seasonal allergies because they can prevent some larger particles from being inhaled. However, if you have seasonal allergies, masks should not be your only protection against pollen exposure because smaller particles can still get through the covering and be inhaled.Wash your masks after each use, particularly if you suffer from seasonal allergies, because the covering may carry particles such as pollen. See information on how to\u00a0wash masks. How can I protect myself from seasonal allergies?The best way to protect yourself against seasonal allergies is to reduce your exposure to pollen. During high pollen days:Limit your time outdoors and seek indoor spaces with clean air.Create a cleaner air space at home to protect yourself from outdoor air irritants during the COVID-19 pandemic. Use a portable air cleaner in one or more rooms. Portable air cleaners work best when run continuously with doors and windows closed.\u00a0Do-it-yourself box fan\u00a0filtration units are a low-cost filtration alternative, but they should never be left unattended.Keep your cleaner air space a comfortable temperature by using air conditioners, heat pumps, fans, and window shades.If you have a forced air system in your home, consult a qualified heating, ventilation, and air conditioning HVAC professional about different filters HEPA or MERV-13 or higher and settings \u201cRecirculate\u201d and \u201cOn\u201d rather than \u201cAuto\u201d that can be used to reduce indoor air irritants.If outdoors, avoid activities that stir up pollen, such as mowing lawns or raking leaves.

Health department staff will help identify the dates for your self-quarantine. Health department staff can also provide resources for COVID-19 testing in your area.Self-quarantine means staying home away from others and monitoring your health.If you need to be around other people or animals in or outside of the home, wear a mask. This will help protect the people around you.If you need support or assistance while in self-quarantine, your health department or community organizations may be able to provide assistance.Monitor your health and watch for symptoms of COVID-19. Remember, symptoms may appear 2-14 days after you were exposed to COVID-19. Tell the health department if you develop any symptoms. Tell people you were around recently if you become ill, so they can monitor their health. If your symptoms worsen or become severe, seek medical care. Severe symptoms include trouble breathing, persistent pain or pressure in the chest, new confusion, inability to wake or stay awake, or pale, gray, or blue-colored skin, lips, or nail beds, depending on skin tone.The health department staff will not ask you forMoneySocial Security numberBank account informationSalary information, orCredit card numbers I was around someone who has COVID-19, and my COVID-19 test came back negative. Do I still need to quarantine for 14 days after I was last exposed?Yes. You should still self-quarantine for 14 days since your last exposure. It can take up to 14 days after exposure to the virus for a person to develop COVID-19 symptoms. A negative result before end of the 14-day quarantine period does not rule out possible infection. By self-quarantining for 14 days, you lower the chance of possibly exposing others to COVID-19. The best way to protect yourself and others is to stay home for 14 days if you think you\u2019ve been exposed to someone who has COVID-19. Check your local health department\u2019s website for information about options in your area to possibly shorten this quarantine period. I was recently around someone who has COVID-19, but I feel fine. Why should I stay at home?People with COVID-19 can still spread the virus even if they don\u2019t have any symptoms. If you were around someone who had COVID-19, it is critical that you stay home and away from others for 14 days from the last day that you were around that person. Staying home and away from others at all times helps your health department in the fight against COVID-19 and helps protect you, your family, and your community.

Top of PageFuneralsAm I at risk if I go to a funeral or visitation service for someone who died of COVID-19?There is currently no known risk associated with being in the same room at a funeral or visitation service with the body of someone who died of COVID-19. However, you may be at risk of getting COVID-19 if you attend a funeral where there are multiple people congregating. For more information about what you can do to help protect yourself and others from COVID-19 during these services, and to help cope with the loss of a loved one, see Funeral Guidance. What should loved ones know about handling belongings and the body of someone who died from COVID-19?The virus that causes COVID-19 is thought to spread\u00a0from close contact i.e., within about 6 feet with a person who is infected with the virus. The virus spreads primarily through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks.This type of spread is not a concern after death. It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads. If the deceased person had confirmed or suspected COVID-19, avoid kissing, washing, or shrouding the body before, during, and after the body has been prepared, if possible. For more information on recommended precautions while handling the belongings and the body of someone who died from COVID-19, see Funeral Guidance.

Destroying a virus is dependent on its physical properties, and recent genetic changes have not changed the basic physical properties of the virus that causes COVID-19.\u200bLearn more about cleaning and disinfection recommendations for\u00a0facilities\u00a0and\u00a0homes. Do car seats and booster seats need extra cleaning and disinfection to prevent spread of COVID-19? If so, how should car seats and booster seats be cleaned and disinfected?It may be possible that people can get COVID-19 by\u00a0touching a surface or object that has the virus on it\u00a0and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this isn\u2019t thought to be the main way the virus spreads. Cleaning with products containing soap or detergent reduces germs on surfaces and objects by removing contaminants and may weaken or damage some of the virus particles, which decreases risk of infection from surfaces. You may choose to also disinfect depending on\u00a0certain conditions or everyday practices required by your home. Washing hands frequently or using hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol also prevent the spread of COVID-19.Some cleaning and disinfectexternal icon\u00a0products are not recommended for use on car seats and booster seats. Owners should follow the manufacturer\u2019s cleaning instructions for their car seats and booster seats. What is the difference between cleaning and disinfecting?Cleaning\u00a0with soap and water or a detergent removes germs, dirt, and impurities from surfaces. It lowers the risk of spreading\u00a0infection.\u00a0Disinfecting with a household disinfectant on List N: Disinfectants for Coronavirus COVID-19external icon\u00a0kills germs on the surface. By disinfecting or killing germs on a surface after cleaning the surface, it can further lower the risk of spreading infection. For more information review cleaning and disinfection recommendations for facilities and homes. Is it safe to vacuum in a school, business, or community facility after someone with COVID-19 was there?The risk of spreading COVID-19 during vacuuming is unknown. At this time, there are no reported cases of COVID-19 associated with vacuuming.After cleaning:Use a vacuum equipped with a high-efficiency particulate air HEPA filter and bags, if available.Do not vacuum a room or space that has people in it. Wait until the room or space is empty to vacuum, such as at night, for common spaces, or during the day for private rooms.While vacuuming, temporarily turn off in-room, window-mounted, or on-wall recirculation HVAC to avoid contamination of the HVAC units.Do NOT deactivate central HVAC systems. These systems tend to provide better filtration capabilities and introduce outdoor air into the areas that they serve. How effective are alternative disinfection methods, such as ultrasonic waves, high intensity UV radiation, and LED blue light?The efficacy of these disinfection methods against the virus that causes COVID-19 is not known. EPA only recommends use of the\u00a0surface disinfectants identified on List Nexternal icon against the virus that causes COVID-19. EPA does not routinely review the safety or efficacy of pesticidal devices, such as UV lights, LED lights, or ultrasonic devices. However, CDC is producing guidance on use of Germicidal ultraviolet as an alternative disinfection method. Therefore, EPA cannot confirm whether, or under what circumstances, such products might be effective against the spread of COVID-19. For more information on CDC\u2019s recommendations for primary surface disinfection in occupied environments please visit the CDC/EPA guidance for surface disinfection. Can sanitizing tunnels be used at facility entrances or exits to prevent the spread of COVID-19?CDC does not recommend the use of sanitizing tunnels. There is no evidence that they are effective in reducing the spread of COVID-19. In addition, chemicals used in sanitizing tunnels could cause skin, eye, or respiratory irritation or damage.\u00a0 Should sidewalks, roads, and other outdoor spaces be disinfected to prevent the spread of COVID-19?CDC does not recommend disinfection of sidewalks, roads, or most other outdoor spaces. Spraying disinfectant on sidewalks, roads, and other outdoor spaces is not an efficient use of disinfectant supplies and has not been proven to reduce the risk of COVID-19 to the public. The risk of spreading the virus that causes COVID-19 from these surfaces is very low and disinfection is not effective on these surfaces. Top of PagePets and AnimalsCan I get COVID-19 from my pets or other animals?Based on the available information to date, the risk of animals spreading COVID-19 to people is considered to be low.

At this time, there is no evidence that companion animals, including pets and service animals, can spread the virus that causes COVID-19. As with any animal introduced to a new environment, animals recently imported should be observed daily for signs of illness. If an animal becomes ill, the animal should be examined by a veterinarian. Call your local veterinary clinic\u00a0before\u00a0bringing the animal into the clinic and let them know that the animal was recently imported from another country.This is a rapidly evolving situation and information will be updated as it becomes available. Can wild animals spread the virus that causes COVID-19 to people or pets?Currently, there is no evidence to suggest the virus that causes COVID-19 is circulating in free-living wildlife in the United States, or that wildlife might be a source of infection for people in the United States.If a wild animal were to become infected with the virus, we don\u2019t know whether the infection could then spread among wildlife or if it could spread to other animals, including pets. Further studies are needed to understand if and how different animals, including wildlife, could be affected by COVID-19. Because wildlife can carry other diseases, even without looking sick, it is always important to enjoy wildlife from a distance.Take steps to prevent getting sick from wildlife in the United States:Keep your family, including pets, a safe distance away from wildlife.Do not feed wildlife or touch wildlife droppings.Always wash your hands and supervise children washing their hands after working or playing outside.Leave orphaned animals alone. Often, the parents are close by and will return for their young.Consult your state wildlife agency\u2019s guidance if you are preparing or consuming legally harvested game meat.Do not approach or touch a sick or dead animal \u2013 contact your state wildlife agency instead.See\u00a0COVID-19 and Animals\u00a0for more information. Can bats in United States get the virus that causes COVID-19, and can they spread it back to people?Other coronaviruses have been found in North American bats in the past, but there is currently no evidence that the virus that causes COVID-19 is present in any free-living wildlife in the United States, including bats. In general, coronaviruses do not cause illness or death in bats, but we don\u2019t yet know if this new coronavirus would make North American species of bats sick. Bats are an important part of natural ecosystems, and their populations are already declining in the United States. Bat populations could be further threatened by the disease itself or by harm inflicted on bats resulting from a misconception that bats are spreading COVID-19. However, there is no evidence that bats in the United States are a source of the virus that causes COVID-19 for people. Further studies are needed to understand if and how bats could be affected by COVID-19. Is hunter-harvested game meat safe to eat during the COVID-19 pandemic?Currently, there is no evidence that you can get infected with the virus that causes COVID-19 by eating food, including wild hunted game meat. However, hunters can get infected with other diseases when processing or eating game.\u00a0 Hunters should always practice good hygiene when processing animals by following these food safety recommendations:Do not harvest animals that appear sick or are found dead.Keep game meat clean and cool the meat down as soon as possible after harvesting the animal.Avoid cutting through the backbone and spinal tissues and do not eat the brains of any wild animal.When handling and cleaning game:Wear rubber or disposable gloves.Do not eat, drink, or smoke.When finished handling and cleaning game:Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water.Clean knives, equipment, and surfaces that were in contact with game meat with soap and water and then disinfect them. While these recommendations apply to general food safety practices, if you are concerned about COVID-19, you may use a product on the EPA list of disinfectants for use against the COVID-19 virusexternal icon.Cook all game meat thoroughly to an internal temperature of 165\u00b0F or higher.Check with your state wildlife agency regarding any testing requirements for other diseases and for any specific instructions regarding preparing, transporting, and consuming game meat. How can I safely run my equestrian facility?You should follow your state and/or local jurisdictional guidance regarding continuing operations at your facility. There have not been any reports of horses testing positive for the virus that causes COVID-19. Based on the limited information available to date, the risk of animals spreading the virus that causes COVID-19 to people is considered to be low. COVID-19 is primarily spread from person to person, so steps should be taken to reduce the risks for people visiting your facility.Encourage employees and other visitors, including boarders, owners, farriers, veterinarians, and those taking lessons, not to enter the facility if they are sick. Employees should not return to work until the criteria to discontinue home isolation\u00a0are met, after talking with their doctor. Implement sick leave policies that are flexible, nonpunitive, and consistent with public health guidance, allowing employees to stay home if they have symptoms of respiratory infection.Consider conducting daily health checks e.g., symptom and/or temperature screening of employees and others visiting the facility before they enter the premises. People with a fever of 100.4038.00C or above or other signs of illness should not be admitted to the premises. If implementing health checks, conduct them safely and respectfully. See General Business FAQs\u00a0for more information.Employees or visitors who appear to have symptoms upon arrival or who become sick during their visit should immediately be separated from other employees and visitors and sent home.Limit the number of people entering the facility. Consider staggering lesson and visiting times to limit the number of people in the facility and potential for person-to-person contact. If possible, you can also take steps to decrease high-traffic areas by limiting areas open to visitors/owners or staggering use of common areas like grooming or wash stalls and tack rooms.Increase distance and limit duration of contact between employees and visitors in the facility. Whenever possible, people should maintain at least 6 feet of distance between each other at the facility, including instructors teaching lessons. Allow for social distancing\u00a0and avoid large numbers of people within the facility, including in employee-only areas.Visitors and employees should wear masks especially where social distancing measures are difficult to maintain. Masks offer some protection to the wearer and are also meant to protect those around the wearer, in case they are infected with the virus that causes COVID-19. Wearing a mask does NOT replace the need to practice social distancing.Set up hand hygiene stations at the entrance and within the facility, so that employees and people entering can clean their hands before they enter. Employees should wash hands regularly with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. An alcohol-based hand sanitizer containing at least 60% alcohol can be used, but if hands are visibly dirty, they should be washed with soap and water before using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer. Examples of hand hygiene stations may be a hose and soap located at entrances to allow for handwashing before entry.Cleaning high touch surfaces and shared objects once a day is usually enough\u00a0to sufficiently remove virus that may be on surfaces unless someone with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 has been in the equestrian facility.\u00a0Disinfecting using disinfectants on\u00a0U.S. Environmental Protection Agency EPA\u2019s List Nexternal icon removes any remaining germs on surfaces, which further reduces any risk of spreading infection.\u00a0\u00a0For more information on cleaning regularly and cleaning when someone is sick, see Cleaning and Disinfecting Your Facility.Follow local guidance on shelter in place and travel recommendations when traveling for showing, training, or trail riding.If traveling to a new facility, limit contact between people, horses, tack, equipment, and other supplies from different facilities, and maintain a distance of at least 6 feet between horses and riders.Follow state and local guidance on travel. People who are sick should not travel to other facilities.People visiting other facilities should follow the same precautions as they would normally, including maintaining at least 6 feet of distance between each other, wearing a mask to protect others, and washing hands frequently with soap and water.If other animals, such as barn cats, are present at the facility, be aware that a small number of pets have been reported to be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, mostly after contact with people with COVID-19.For more information, see Guidance on Preparing Workplaces for COVID-19 pdf icon[35 pages, 1.4mb]external icon\u00a0and Interim Guidance for Businesses and Employers to Plan and Respond to Coronavirus Disease 2019 COVID-19. Can the virus that causes COVID-19 get back into the environment from wastewater and infect wildlife?SARS-CoV-2 the virus that causes COVID-19 can be shed in the feces of people with COVID-19. Genetic material from SARS-CoV-2 has been found in untreated wastewater. However, while data are limited, there is little evidence of infectious virus in wastewater, and no information to date that anyone has become sick with COVID-19 because of exposure to wastewater. It is possible that wildlife could become infected with SARS-CoV-2 from contact with untreated wastewater, but evidence from studies of virus infectivity in feces and survival in wastewater suggests that this transmission route is unlikely to occur. See also: Pets and Other AnimalsTop of PageCommunity MitigationWhat is community mitigation?Community mitigation is a set of actions that people and communities can take to slow the spread of infectious diseases like COVID-19. The goal of community mitigation in areas with local COVID-19 transmission is to slow its spread and to protect all individuals, especially those at increased risk for severe illness, while minimizing the negative impacts of these strategies. For more information, see Community Mitigation Framework. What are community mitigation actions for COVID-19?There are several actions that individuals and communities can take to help reduce the chance that they, their families and friends, and their communities get COVID-19. In general, the more cases spreading in your community, the more likely it will spread to you or your family. Also, the more people an individual interacts with, and the longer each interaction lasts, the higher the risk of viral spread. Location can be a factor, too, with outdoor activities generally being less risky than indoor activities.\u00a0Individuals can take the following community mitigation actions:Wear a mask with some exceptions when in public settings or around others not living in the same householdFollow healthy hygiene practices, such as frequent hand washingPractice social distancingStay home when sickClean frequently touched surfaces dailyCommunities can take the following actions:Promote behaviors that prevent spreadMaintain healthy environmentsEnsure institutions in the community are practicing appropriate precautionsPrepare for when someone gets sickClose businesses and schools, and limit other servicesFor more information, see Community Guidance, Community Mitigation, and Community Mitigation Framework.

Water treatment plants use filters and disinfectants to remove or kill germs, like the virus that causes COVID-19. The Environmental Protection Agency regulates water treatment plants to ensure that treated water is safe to drink.Currently, there is no evidence that the virus that causes COVID-19 can be spread to people by drinking treated water. COVID-19 is spread mainly through close contact from person-to-person.\u00a0You can continue to use and drink water from your tap as usual. Is the virus that causes COVID-19 found in feces stool?The virus that causes COVID-19 has been found in the feces of some patients diagnosed with COVID-19. However, it is unclear whether the virus found in feces may be capable of causing COVID-19. There has not been any confirmed report of the virus spreading from feces to a person. Scientists also do not know how much risk there is that the virus could be spread from the feces of an infected person to another person. However, they think this risk is low based on data from previous outbreaks of diseases caused by related coronaviruses, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome MERS. Can the COVID-19 virus spread through wastewater systems?SARS-CoV-2 the virus that causes COVID-19 can be shed in the feces of individuals with COVID-19. Genetic material from SARS-CoV-2 has been found in untreated wastewater. However, while data are limited, there is little evidence of infectious virus in wastewater, and no information to date that anyone has become sick with COVID-19 because of exposure to wastewater. Wastewater treatment plants use chemical and other disinfection processes to remove and degrade many viruses and bacteria. SARS-CoV-2 is inactivated by the disinfection methods used in wastewater treatment. At this time, the risk of transmission of the virus that causes COVID-19 through properly designed and maintained wastewater systems is thought to be low. Should wastewater workers take extra precautions to protect themselves from the virus that causes COVID-19?Recently, ribonucleic acid RNA from the virus that causes COVID-19 has been found in untreated wastewater. While data are limited, there is little evidence of infectious virus in wastewater, and no information to date that anyone has become sick with COVID-19 because of exposure to wastewater.Standard practices associated with wastewater treatment plant operations should be sufficient to protect wastewater workers from the virus that causes COVID-19. These standard practices can include engineering and administrative controls, hygiene precautions, specific safe work practices, and personal protective equipment PPE normally required when handling untreated wastewater. No additional COVID-19\u2013specific protections are recommended for workers involved in wastewater management, including those at wastewater treatment facilities.See Information for Wastewater and Sanitation System Workers on COVID-19 for additional information. If my utility has issued a Boil Water Advisory, can I still use tap water to wash my hands?In most cases, it is safe to wash your hands\u00a0with soap and tap water during a Boil Water Advisory. Follow the guidance from your local public health officials. If soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer containing at least 60% alcohol. Can the virus that causes COVID-19 spread to people through floodwater?There is\u00a0no evidence that COVID-19 can spread to people through water, including floodwater.Sometimes floodwater can mix with\u00a0wastewater. CDC is not aware of any scientific reports of the virus being spread by swallowing or coming in contact with water contaminated by feces from an infected person.\u00a0Stay out of floodwater to\u00a0avoid hazards and illnesses\u00a0from contaminants that are not associated with COVID-19. To learn more about COVID-19 and wastewater, see question, \u201cCan the COVID-19 virus spread through sewerage systems?\u201d Top of PagePools, Hot Tubs, and Water PlaygroundsCan the virus that causes COVID-19 spread to people through the water in pools, hot tubs, or water playgrounds?CDC is not aware of any scientific reports of the virus that causes COVID-19 spreading to people through the water in pools, hot tubs, or water playgrounds. Plus, proper operation of public pools, hot tubs, and water playgrounds such as at an apartment complex or owned by a community and disinfection of the water with chlorine or bromine should inactivate the virus.The virus mainly spreads when respiratory droplets from infected people land in the mouths or noses of others or possibly when inhaled into the lungs by others. If a public pool, hot tub, or water playground is open, it is important for all visitors and staff to take steps to slow the spread of the virus:Stay home if you are infected or might be infected\u00a0with the virus that causes COVID-19.Stay at least 6 feet apart in and out of the water from people you don\u2019t live with.Wear cloth masks\u00a0when not in water.Cover coughs and sneezes with a tissue or use the inside of your elbow, throw used tissues in the trash, and wash hands.Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. Use hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol if soap and water are not readily available.See Considerations for Public Pools, Hot Tubs, and Water Playgrounds\u00a0for more information. Can the virus that causes COVID-19 spread to people through the water in saltwater pools?CDC is not aware of any scientific reports of the virus that causes COVID-19 spreading to people through the water in pools, including saltwater pools. Plus, proper operation\u00a0of public pools such as at an apartment complex or owned by a community and disinfection of the water with chlorine or bromine should inactivate the virus. Saltwater pools are chlorinated pools.In traditional pools, chlorine products such as granules or liquid bleach are added to the water to disinfect it. In saltwater pools, table salt made up of sodium and chloride is added to the water, and an electrical current is then run through the water with dissolved salt. This creates the same disinfecting form of chlorine that is created when chlorine products are added to the water in traditional pools. Can the virus that causes COVID-19 spread to people through the water in lakes, oceans, or rivers?CDC is not aware of any scientific reports of the virus that causes COVID-19 spreading to people through the water in lakes, oceans, rivers, or other natural bodies of water.The virus mainly spreads when respiratory droplets from infected people land in the mouths or noses of others or possibly when inhaled into the lungs by others. If a public beach or other swim area in a natural body of water is open, it is important for all visitors and staff to take steps to slow the spread of the virus:Stay home if you are infected or might be infected\u00a0with the virus that causes COVID-19.Stay at least 6 feet apart in and out of the water from people you don\u2019t live with.Wear cloth masks\u00a0when not in water.Cover coughs and sneezes with a tissue or use the inside of your elbow, throw used tissues in the trash, and wash hands.Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. Use hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol if soap and water are not readily available.See Considerations for Public Beaches\u00a0for more information.RNAexternal icon of the virus that causes COVID-19 has been found in untreated wastewater, which can come from combined sewer overflowsexternal icon rainwater runoff, domestic sewage, and industrial wastewater and other sourcesexternal icon\u00a0such as, leaking septic tanks or animal waste from farms nearby and enter swim areas. While data are limited, there is little evidence of infectious virus in wastewater. Plus, CDC is not aware of any scientific reports of the virus being spread by swallowing or coming in contact with water contaminated by feces poop from an infected person.At lakes, oceans, and rivers with routine water quality monitoring programs, staff look for changes in fecal poop contamination of the water. Water quality advisories and beach closures alert the public to avoid getting in or on the water because of increased fecal contamination. Learn more about healthy swimming in natural bodies of water and access water quality information by state. Can cloth masks be worn in the water?No, do NOT wear a cloth mask in the water. It can be difficult to breathe through a cloth mask when it is wet. Plus, wet cloth masks don\u2019t slow the spread of the virus that causes COVID-19 as well as dry cloth masks. All of this means it is particularly important to stay at least 6 feet apart\u00a0in the water from people you don\u2019t live with.In case cloth masks do get wet by mistake, bring a second or extra cloth mask for everyone heading out to the public pool or beach. Can Lycra Spandex or elastane, the cloth used to make swimsuits, be used to make cloth masks?CDC does not yet have evidence on the effectiveness of different types of cloth materials.Masks offer some protection to you and are also meant to protect those around you, in case you are unknowingly infected with the virus that causes COVID-19. Make sure your cloth mask:fits snugly but comfortably against the side of the face,completely covers the nose and mouth,is secured with ties or ear loops,includes multiple layers of fabric,allows for breathing without restriction, andcan be laundered and machine dried without damage or change to shape.Cloth masks should NOT be worn by children less than 2 years old or anyone who has trouble breathing or is unconscious, incapacitated, or otherwise unable to remove the mask without assistance. Learn more about how to wear, take off, and wash\u00a0your cloth masks.\u00a0 How many people, visitors and staff, can be in and around a public pool, hot tub, or water playground such as at an apartment complex or owned by a community at the same time?The design of the public pool, hot tub, or water playground and surrounding deck and if visitors live together or not will affect how many people can stay at least 6 feet apart\u00a0from those they don\u2019t live with.CDC recommends operators of public pools, hot tubs, and water playgrounds:comply with local, state, territorial, federal, and tribal regulatory agency policies and requirements on gathering so the number of swimmers in the water isn\u2019t more than the maximum allowed andteach and reinforce social physical distancing\u00a0among visitors and staff.Operators might want to limit the number of people in and around the water so if the water needs to be evacuated because of lightning or other health or safety threat social distancing can be maintained on the deck. Otherwise, if the water is evacuated and social distancing cannot be maintained on the deck, close the deck to visitors. There is no standard formula to determine how many people can maintain social distancing in the water and on the surrounding deck.See Considerations for Public Pools, Hot Tubs, and Water Playgrounds\u00a0for more information. Can I use pool, hot tub, or water playground water to disinfect surfaces or shared objects?No. Only List N disinfectants approved by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agencyexternal icon\u00a0should be used to disinfect surfaces such as handrails and in bathrooms and shared objects such as kickboards and pool noodles.The list includes hundreds of disinfectants. Operators of public pools, hot tubs, or water playgrounds such as at an apartment complex or owned by a community should consult with the design company or engineer to determine which disinfectants are best suited for surfaces and with manufacturers to determine which disinfectants are best suited for shared objects.Remember to clean surfaces and shared objects before disinfecting them\u00a0and to follow directions on labels of cleaning products and disinfectants. Can the sun\u2019s ultraviolet UV light disinfect surfaces and shared objects?We don\u2019t know yet. Early scientific data suggest that SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, can be inactivated by the sun\u2019s UV light. However, the ability of the sun\u2019s UV light to inactivate the virus on surfaces such as handrails and in bathrooms and shared objects such as kickboards and pool noodles needs more research. Factors \u2014 such as cloudiness, latitude distance from equator, time of day, and amount of time exposed to the sun\u2019s UV light \u2014 will determine how effectively the virus is inactivated.Remember to clean surfaces and shared objects before disinfecting them and to follow directions on labels of cleaning products and disinfectantsexternal icon. How often do surfaces such as handrails and in bathrooms at public pools, hot tubs, or water playgrounds such as at an apartment complex or owned by a community need to be cleaned and disinfected?The more frequently a surface is touched by multiple people, the more frequently it should be cleaned and then disinfected with a List N disinfectant approved by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agencyexternal icon. Frequently touched surfaces should be cleaned and disinfected at least daily.Remember to clean surfaces and shared objects before disinfecting them\u00a0and to follow directions on labels of cleaning products and disinfectants. Do procedures for responding to formed fecal poop or diarrheal incidents in public pools, hot tubs, or water playgrounds such as at an apartment complex or owned by a community need to change during the COVID-19 pandemic?No. RNAexternal icon of the virus that causes COVID-19 has been found in feces poop. While data are limited, there is little evidence of infectious virus in feces. Plus, CDC is not aware of any scientific reports of the virus being spread by swallowing or coming in contact with water contaminated by feces from an infected person. As a result, CDC has not changed its fecal incident response recommendations. Remember, do NOT vacuum feces out of the water. Can lifeguards monitor how visitors socially distance stay at least 6 feet apart from people you don\u2019t live with, wear cloth masks, or wash hands?Not when lifeguards are actively lifeguarding. Lifeguards actively lifeguarding should not be doing other tasks that could distract them. Drowning deaths have resulted, at least in part, from lifeguards being distracted.\u00a0Drowning can occur quickly and quietly. Learn and take steps to prevent drowning. How can the spread of the virus that causes COVID-19 be slowed during lifeguard training?Lifeguard trainers can consider the following steps to slow the spread of the virus that causes COVID-19:Have the virus? Stay home to save lives.Educate instructors, lifeguard students, and others about when they should stay home to isolate if they have symptoms of COVID-19 or tested positive for COVID-19 or quarantine if they have been in close contact with someone who has COVID-19 and when they can return or reschedule training.Conduct daily health checks see frequently asked question on screening or ask instructors, students, and others to conduct self-checks such as temperature screening or symptom checking, if possible.Conduct health checks safely and respectfully and in accordance with any applicable local, state, territorial, federal, and tribal privacy and confidentiality laws, rules, and regulations.Be smart, stay at least 6 feet apartConduct knowledge training virtually or online, when possible, to limit contact among instructors, students, and others.Teach and reinforce social physical distancing\u00a0during in-person skills training in and out of the water \u2014 maintaining at least 6 feet between people who don\u2019t live together.Provide physical cues or guides such as lane lines in the water or chairs and tables on the deck and visual cues such as posted signs or tape on the deck.Limit close contact, particularly face-to-face interactions, between people who don\u2019t live together, as recommended by the lifeguarding-certifying organization. Such asAquatic rescueFor practice rescuesHave each student practice rescues on his or her household member instead of another student.For actual rescuesStress the need to keep the number of people involved in rescue and resuscitation to the minimum number needed to provide proper care.Stress the need to 1 perform rescues from the deck using an extending or throwing device if conditions allow and 2 if possible, have people on the deck wear cloth masks, when removing victim from the water because social distancing cannot be maintained. If an in-water rescue is needed, minimize exposure to the distressed swimmer\u2019s face without protection, if possible approaching him or her from behind.Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation CPRFor practice resuscitationLimit student-to-manikin ratio and student-to-automated external defibrillator AED training device ratio to 1:1. Have each student use his or her own breathing barrier when doing rescue breathing on a manikin.For actual resuscitationStress the need for and train with personal protective equipment PPE during resuscitation, as recommended by the CPR-certifying organization such as the American Red Crossexternal icon, and use a bag-valve mask BVM with a high-efficiency particulate air HEPA filter. BVM ventilation is best delivered with two rescuers.Wear a mask. Save lives.Teach and reinforce use of cloth masks\u00a0in public settings when around people you don\u2019t live with, particularly when it is difficult to maintain social distancing.Advise people wearing masks to not wear them in the water. Cloth masks can be difficult to breathe through when they\u2019re wet. This means it is particularly important to maintain social distancing in the water. Plus, wet cloth masks don\u2019t slow the spread of the virus that causes COVID-19 as well as dry cloth masks.Cover coughs and sneezesTeach and reinforce covering coughs and sneezes with a tissue or use the inside of elbow, throw used tissues in the trash, and wash hands.Wash hands oftenTeach and reinforce handwashing\u00a0with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, particularly after being in a public place or after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing.Use hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol, if soap and water are not readily available.Clean and then disinfectCleaning with a household cleaner that contains soap or detergent reduces the amount of germs on surfaces and decreases risk of infection from surfaces. In most situations, cleaning alone removes most virus particles on surfaces. Disinfection to reduce spread of COVID-19 at home is likely not needed unless someone in your home is sick or someone with COVID-19 has been in your home within the last 24 hours. For more information on cleaning your home regularly and cleaning your home when someone is sick, see\u00a0Cleaning and Disinfecting Your Home.CDC has more COVID-19\u2013related considerations for public pools and public beaches and non-COVID-19\u2013related healthy and safe swimming resources.

Occupancy Limits     Rooms and areas should be assessed to determine the number of people who can safely distance while using the space based on current guidelines. \u00a0UCR recommends that spaces not be occupied more than 25% of approved code occupancy and a 6-foot distance must be maintained for the initial phase of reoccupancy. \u00a0This recommendation is expected to change as the state moves into future phases of recovery and will be messaged to the campus. \u00a0Signs indicating new occupancy limits should be posted at room entrances. \u00a0\u00a0Printable occupancy signage can be found on the EH&S website.Limit the number of workers in areas to ensure at least six feet of separation and no more than 25% of approved code occupancy. For questions on approved occupancy, contact EH&S or Space Management. \u00a0Some common areas may be closed, or access restricted, to prevent use and minimize areas that require frequent disinfection.\u00a0Elevators are currently limited to one rider at a time.\t\u00a0            Ventilation    In coordination with Facilities Services, environmental health and safety will evaluate indoor locations for adequate ventilation on a case-by-case basis. Evaluations will occur based upon information obtained in Worksite Specific Plans. The quantity of outdoor air for indoor locations being evaluated will be maximized to the greatest extent feasible. Ventilation systems will also be evaluated to ensure that filtration efficiency is maximized to the highest level compatible with the existing system.\u00a0There are instances when outside air quantities in naturally or mechanically ventilated spaces cannot be maximized due to environmental conditions. These conditions include:\u00a0When the United States Environmental Protection Agency EPA Air Quality Index is greater than 100 for any pollutant.When the outside air temperature is excessively hot or cold.\u00a0When a worksite has been identified as the location of a COVID-19 outbreak of 3 or more COVID-19 cases within 14 days, an investigation into issues concerning insufficient outdoor air or insufficient air filtration will be accomplished. Certain indoor tasks may be moved outdoors or performed remotely if increases in outdoor air or air filtration improvement cannot be accomplished due to ventilation system limitations.\u00a0When a worksite has been identified as the location of a COVID-19 outbreak of 20 or more COVID-19 cases within 30 days, indoor locations with mechanical ventilation will be evaluated to determine if filter efficiency can be increased to filters with a Minimum Efficiency Reporting Value MERV 13 or higher. MERV 13 or higher efficiency filter MERV 13 or higher efficiency filter, then suppose the ventilation system is not compatible with a filter with a MERV 13 or higher efficiency. In that case, operations within that specific area will be moved to an outdoor location, or the operations will be performed remotely. Portable or mounted High-Efficiency Particulate Air HEPA filtration units, or other air cleaning systems, will be considered a last resort method to reduce the last resort method to reduce transmission risk, where feasible.Do not use campus or grant funds to purchase HEPA or other air filtration units unless there is specific approval from the UCR Senior Industrial Hygienist. Employees may not bring personal HEPA or other filtration units to campus for use. Any personal units found will be unplugged and will be disposed of within 48 hours if not removed.\t\u00a0            Cleaning & Disinfection     Facilities Services will provide cleaning and disinfection services for the campus, focusing on public areas such as public restrooms. Departments are required to assist with additional cleaning and disinfection of high-touch areas in spaces assigned to them.Disinfection supplies should be acquired from Facilities Services in order to ensure products meet EPA criteria for COVID-19 disinfection. Information on these items is available on the Facilities Services website. \u00a0The Facilities Services website also provides information on the Custodial Cleaning Schedule for different space types to help with departmental disinfection planning.If an employee tests positive for COVID-19 after working on campus, Facilities Services will work with the department to clean and disinfect areas likely contaminated as recommended by the CDC. Entire buildings will not be shut down unless warranted.\u00a0            Specific Spaces    Information on using specific spaces such as offices, public areas, and common facilities Library, HUB, etc. can be found on this page.\u00a0 This information is subject to change due to State or local regulations.\u00a0            Work Schedules    All units and departments will need to maintain distancing practices while working onsite. Employees must work with their immediate supervisors to develop a work schedule that works for the campus, department, and fellow employees using shared work and break areas. \u00a0Supervisors may also have to coordinate with the Human Resources staff as represented employees may have different requirements. \u00a0Considerations to ensure safe distancing may include:\u00a0Continue remote work, if feasible. \u00a0Supervisors should discuss with their employees.\u00a0Stagger start times\u00a0Stagger schedules for lunch and break times\u00a0Establish alternating work schedules\u00a0Add weekend or evening shifts, if appropriate - take into consideration personal safety and building access issue ContactFor more information or additional guidance, please contact:Sharyl Murdocksharyl.murdock@ucr.eduSearchUniversity of California, Riverside900 University Ave.            Riverside, CA 92521Tel: 951 827-1012UCR LibraryCampus StatusCampus StoreCareer OpportunitiesDiversityMaps and DirectionsVisit UCRUniversity of California, Riverside             900 University Ave.            Riverside, CA 92521                                                 email: webmaster@ucr.edu  Find UsRelated LinksFeedbackEnvironmental Health and SafetyFacility ServicesHuman ResourcesKeep ResearchingPrivacy PolicyTerms and Conditions\u00a9 2021 Regents of the University of California\u00d7Let us help you with your searchEnter your Search Criteria.SearchCancel"}, {"id": 253, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLIBpM9gjaPckxGtdxU1BzGzWOQY8n351x/", "html": "AboutPressCopyrightContact usCreatorsAdvertiseDevelopersTermsPrivacyPolicy & SafetyHow YouTube worksTest new features\u00a9 2021 Google LLC"}, {"id": 254, "url": "https://uc.sumtotal.host/core/pillarRedirect?relyingParty=LM&url=app%2Fmanagement%2FLMS_ActDetails.aspx%3FActivityId%3D401911%26UserMode%3D0&domain=14/", "html": "\r\t\t\tThe site you are trying to access requires you to sign in.\r\t\t\tSelect your provider to login.\r      Remember my selection\r        21.1.5.0\r      \r        Copyright \u00a9 2004-2021 SumTotal Systems, LLC.

You can also call us weekdays during campus business hours Monday - Friday / 8am - 5pm at 951 827-4214.\u00a0HVAC Ventilation\u00a0FAQsGeneral COVID-19 infection prevention recommendations should be followed by building occupants regardless of the HVAC functionality. This includes, but is not limited to:\u00a0Social distancing by remaining 6 feet or further away from other persons.\u00a0Wearing a face covering while on campus or interacting with others.\u00a0Following CDC recommendations for handwashing, which includes use of soap and water and washing for 20 seconds.\u00a0Washing hands after touching commonly touched surfaces such as door knobs, light switches, shared equipment, etc.\u00a0Not touching your face without first washing your hands.\u00a0Building occupancy should be reduced to meet safe distancing requirements. Ventilation systems will continue to operate as designed.\u00a0Maintaining building systems, including HVAC systems, supports safe occupancy on an ongoing basis by ensuring proper ventilation in all occupied spaces.\u00a0UCR is utilizing California Department of Public Health CDPH COVID-19 Industry Guidance for Institutions of Higher Education, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC, and American Society of Heating, Refrigeration and Air-Conditioning Engineers ASHRAE to inform HVAC-related measures on campus.\u00a0To download a PDF version of these FAQs, click here.\u00a0            What steps will Facilities Services take to reduce risk through building ventilation HVAC?    All campus buildings that are open to the public during normal times are safe environments. Some of our buildings are much older and have some limitations. Our buildings are designed to provide sufficient air changes based on building activities. We are making a special effort to ensure that all buildings have current filter changes. The information below is how HVAC systems are maintained.\u00a0Expanded Timeframe: To help with airflow, Facilities Services is expanding the length of time outside airflow will circulate throughout each building.\u00a0Filtration Maintenance: Building filtration systems are well-maintained and have the appropriate level of filters for each building.\u00a0Air Flow: To accommodate efficient airflow in each building, the most advanced level of filters are being used based on the buildings air filtration system capabilities.\u00a0Building VentilationStrict adherence to the public health posters and other visual cues throughout campus and in buildings will reduce transmission risks. Ventilation systems will continue to operate as designed even through building occupancy will be reduced. This will further reduce the risk of potential airborne transmission. While each individual occupant of a campus building will want to make sure these guidelines are followed, including limited occupancy, it will be very important to ensure that all the other occupants in that building, at least on that same floor, coordinate to ensure the overall density and guidelines are being followed on a collective basis.\u00a0Transmission Reduction EffortsAccording to the World Health Organization WHO and the Centers for Disease Control CDC, the COVID-19 virus appears to spread human-to-human through respiratory droplets coming from an infected person. Based on public guidance, the key transmission reduction factors include:physical distancing,limiting occupancy,practicing good personal hygiene andutilizing face coveringsAs part of the public health guidance, Facilities Services will disinfect high-touch areas including elevators, door handles, common areas and restrooms. We have made disinfecting kits available to departments and hand sanitizing stations are located at the entrance of each building. A map locating sanitizing stations can be reviewed by clicking,\u00a0here.\u00a0            How many air changes per hour are in my room?     Air changes per hour ACH is defined as the volume of ventilation air that is supplied and removed from the room every hour. The ventilation air can be through natural or mechanical ventilation systems and helps to remove contaminants from a room.The number of air changes per hour in each room in a building can vary throughout campus.In general, laboratories are typically supplied with 6-12 air changes per hour, and office areas are typically supplied with 4-8 air changes per hour in accordance with the American\u00a0Society of Heating, Refrigeration and Air-Conditioning Engineers ASHRAE standards.The campus is implementing reduced public health occupancy limits for spaces. This will allow for more outside air available per occupant.\u00a0            I am concerned about COVID-19 and the air quality in my work area. How do I know my work area has adequate ventilation?    UCR buildings are typically supplied with a percentage of outside air, either via natural ventilation or mechanical fans, dependent on each building and system. Those systems are maintained to provide ventilation and thermal comfort as designed through the following activities.\u00a0Filtration Maintenance: Building filtration systems are well maintained and have the appropriate level of filters for each buildings mechanical design.\u00a0HVAC systems are set to maintain appropriate indoor temperatures as much as system designs allow, which minimizes thermal stresses on the body. These systems are optimized to bring in the maximum amount of fresh air feasible while still maintaining recommended indoor temperature ranges. In most cases, laboratory ventilation systems operate continuously with 100% outside air supply that is not recirculated in the building and is exhausted directly to the outside. These systems are already designed to exhaust indoor contaminants effectively.\u00a0In most cases, exhaust fans in restrooms operate continuously when buildings are occupied. For restroom exhaust fans to work best, it is recommended to avoid opening operable windows in restrooms and keep restroom doors closed or mostly closed for single restrooms not in use. When possible, keeping conference room doors open can help promote good ventilation.Spaces are more limited or no mechanical ventilation will have operable windows left open.\u00a0A process for reporting critical building HVAC issues on the UCR campus continues to remain the same and in place through the UCR Facilities Services Client Support Services\u00a0Team. For critical HVAC issues, such as non-operational thermostats or building pressure issues, submit a work order at\u00a0https://facilities.ucr.edu/requests. For general inquiries, email us at facilities@ucr.edu or call 951 827-4214 during normal business hours Mon-Fri 8am -5pm.            What is being done to building HVAC in regards to COVID-19?    During our normal preventative maintenance, Facilities Services continues to check HVAC systems to ensure that buildings are ready for reoccupation, including but not limited to the\u00a0following:\tFan systems are functional and operating.Central HVAC fan filters are within acceptable operating ranges and replaced as necessary.Fan filter racks are inspected for major gaps or damage.Occupied/Unoccupied Timeframe: To help with airflow, Facilities Services is ensuring the length of time airflow will circulate throughout each building, starting air handler systems 2 hours prior to normal building occupancy hours and turning off an hour after building occupancy hours.Air filter efficiency ratings are selected in accordance with ASHRAE standards based on mechanical capabilities of the system, to provide required fresh air without loss of pressure. MERV 13 or better filters are used whenever possible.            Can I turn on a portable air-conditioning unit or fan when it gets too hot? Can I use or purchase a portable air cleaner or air filter for my area?    Due to air balancing and electrical capacity, we do not allow portable air conditioners, fans or heaters in mechanically ventilated spaces.            Can the building\u2019s outdoor air ventilation rate be increased?    Outside air rates are set by the building mechanical design and these rates cannot be increased without adversely affecting air conditioning control. Keep in mind that reduced public health occupancy limits for spaces will allow for more outside air available per occupant without making changes to mechanical systems.            Can my building\u2019s supply airflow or exhaust airflow be increased or rebalanced?    Indoor air exchange rates are set by the building mechanical design and these rates cannot be increased without adversely affecting air conditioning control.            What ventilation is provided in stairwells?    While some stairwells may have operable windows, stairwells are not provided with mechanical ventilation.SearchUniversity of California, Riverside900 University Ave.            Riverside, CA 92521Tel: 951 827-1012UCR LibraryCampus StatusCampus StoreCareer OpportunitiesDiversityMaps and DirectionsVisit UCRUniversity of California, Riverside             3401 Watkins Drive            Riverside, CA 92507                          tel: 951 827-4214                        email: facilities@ucr.edu  Find UsPrivacy PolicyTerms and Conditions\u00a9 2021 Regents of the University of California\u00d7Let us help you with your searchEnter your Search Criteria.SearchCancel"}, {"id": 260, "url": "https://facilities.ucr.edu/fs-campus-return-support-information#how_often_will_the_areas_in_my_building_be_cleaned/", "html": "Skip to main contentFacilities Services Submit a Service RequestSearchUC Riverside Facilities Services  SearchHomeServicesBusiness OperationsClient Support Services Energy & EngineeringEnvironmental & Resource ServicesMaintenance ServicesFall ReturnService RatesOutagesUtility Interruption CalendarSubmit RequestRProjects ContactLeadershipSubmit a Service RequestFS Campus Return Support InformationBreadcrumbFS Campus Return Support InformationResources and\u00a0news about Facilities Services return to campus efforts.\u00a0This page will be updated as additional information becomes available.

Based on public guidance, the key transmission reduction factors include:physical distancing,limiting occupancy,practicing good personal hygiene andutilizing face coveringsAs part of the public health guidance, Facilities Services will disinfect high-touch areas including elevators, door handles, common areas and restrooms. We have made disinfecting kits available to departments and hand sanitizing stations are located at the entrance of each building. A map locating sanitizing stations can be reviewed by clicking,\u00a0here.\u00a0            How many air changes per hour are in my room?     Air changes per hour ACH is defined as the volume of ventilation air that is supplied and removed from the room every hour. The ventilation air can be through natural or mechanical ventilation systems and helps to remove contaminants from a room.The number of air changes per hour in each room in a building can vary throughout campus.In general, laboratories are typically supplied with 6-12 air changes per hour, and office areas are typically supplied with 4-8 air changes per hour in accordance with the American\u00a0Society of Heating, Refrigeration and Air-Conditioning Engineers ASHRAE standards.The campus is implementing reduced public health occupancy limits for spaces. This will allow for more outside air available per occupant.\u00a0            I am concerned about COVID-19 and the air quality in my work area. How do I know my work area has adequate ventilation?    UCR buildings are typically supplied with a percentage of outside air, either via natural ventilation or mechanical fans, dependent on each building and system. Those systems are maintained to provide ventilation and thermal comfort as designed through the following activities.\u00a0Filtration Maintenance: Building filtration systems are well maintained and have the appropriate level of filters for each buildings mechanical design.\u00a0HVAC systems are set to maintain appropriate indoor temperatures as much as system designs allow, which minimizes thermal stresses on the body. These systems are optimized to bring in the maximum amount of fresh air feasible while still maintaining recommended indoor temperature ranges. In most cases, laboratory ventilation systems operate continuously with 100% outside air supply that is not recirculated in the building and is exhausted directly to the outside. These systems are already designed to exhaust indoor contaminants effectively.\u00a0In most cases, exhaust fans in restrooms operate continuously when buildings are occupied. For restroom exhaust fans to work best, it is recommended to avoid opening operable windows in restrooms and keep restroom doors closed or mostly closed for single restrooms not in use. When possible, keeping conference room doors open can help promote good ventilation.Spaces are more limited or no mechanical ventilation will have operable windows left open.\u00a0A process for reporting critical building HVAC issues on the UCR campus continues to remain the same and in place through the UCR Facilities Services Client Support Services\u00a0Team. For critical HVAC issues, such as non-operational thermostats or building pressure issues, submit a work order at\u00a0https://facilities.ucr.edu/requests. For general inquiries, email us at facilities@ucr.edu or call 951 827-4214 during normal business hours Mon-Fri 8am -5pm.            What is being done to building HVAC in regards to COVID-19?    During our normal preventative maintenance, Facilities Services continues to check HVAC systems to ensure that buildings are ready for reoccupation, including but not limited to the\u00a0following:\tFan systems are functional and operating.Central HVAC fan filters are within acceptable operating ranges and replaced as necessary.Fan filter racks are inspected for major gaps or damage.Occupied/Unoccupied Timeframe: To help with airflow, Facilities Services is ensuring the length of time airflow will circulate throughout each building, starting air handler systems 2 hours prior to normal building occupancy hours and turning off an hour after building occupancy hours.Air filter efficiency ratings are selected in accordance with ASHRAE standards based on mechanical capabilities of the system, to provide required fresh air without loss of pressure. MERV 13 or better filters are used whenever possible.            Can I turn on a portable air-conditioning unit or fan when it gets too hot? Can I use or purchase a portable air cleaner or air filter for my area?    Due to air balancing and electrical capacity, we do not allow portable air conditioners, fans or heaters in mechanically ventilated spaces.            Can the building\u2019s outdoor air ventilation rate be increased?    Outside air rates are set by the building mechanical design and these rates cannot be increased without adversely affecting air conditioning control. Keep in mind that reduced public health occupancy limits for spaces will allow for more outside air available per occupant without making changes to mechanical systems.            Can my building\u2019s supply airflow or exhaust airflow be increased or rebalanced?    Indoor air exchange rates are set by the building mechanical design and these rates cannot be increased without adversely affecting air conditioning control.            What ventilation is provided in stairwells?    While some stairwells may have operable windows, stairwells are not provided with mechanical ventilation.SearchUniversity of California, Riverside900 University Ave.            Riverside, CA 92521Tel: 951 827-1012UCR LibraryCampus StatusCampus StoreCareer OpportunitiesDiversityMaps and DirectionsVisit UCRUniversity of California, Riverside             3401 Watkins Drive            Riverside, CA 92507                          tel: 951 827-4214                        email: facilities@ucr.edu  Find UsPrivacy PolicyTerms and Conditions\u00a9 2021 Regents of the University of California\u00d7Let us help you with your searchEnter your Search Criteria.SearchCancel"}, {"id": 261, "url": "https://ucrgis.maps.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=2d9f207477cc4dbb955d09769a136e30/", "html": ""}, {"id": 262, "url": "https://facilities.ucr.edu/document/fs-covid-19-rtw-ventilation-faqs/", "html": "Skip to main contentFacilities Services Submit a Service RequestSearchUC Riverside Facilities Services  SearchHomeServicesBusiness OperationsClient Support Services Energy & EngineeringEnvironmental & Resource ServicesMaintenance ServicesFall ReturnService RatesOutagesUtility Interruption CalendarSubmit RequestRProjects ContactLeadershipSubmit a Service RequestBreadcrumbFS COVID-19 RTW Ventilation FAQsPlease Click Here to Download the File SearchUniversity of California, Riverside900 University Ave.            Riverside, CA 92521Tel: 951 827-1012UCR LibraryCampus StatusCampus StoreCareer OpportunitiesDiversityMaps and DirectionsVisit UCRUniversity of California, Riverside             3401 Watkins Drive            Riverside, CA 92507                          tel: 951 827-4214                        email: facilities@ucr.edu  Find UsPrivacy PolicyTerms and Conditions\u00a9 2021 Regents of the University of California\u00d7Let us help you with your searchEnter your Search Criteria.SearchCancel"}, {"id": 263, "url": "https://o365ucr.sharepoint.com/:b:/s/EHS/Training/EVwJ5Q2-28tEqUzTDNrz5xgBn1YX8kiwDa_r38SWBDp3Vw/", "html": "\r\t\r\tThis link has been removed.\rSorry, access to this document has been removed.
